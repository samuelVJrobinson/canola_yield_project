    \caption[Plot arrangement for surveys in hybrid seed fields]{Plot arrangement for surveys in hybrid seed fields, showing hypothetical arrangement of leafcutter shelters ($\Delta$), and male-fertile (\Hermaphrodite) and female bays (\Female) at 5m from the edge of the field. Plots were placed 5, 20, 100, and 400m along a transect (dashed line) from the field edge nearest to the set of honey bee hives. Plots were placed side-by-side in the male bay and edge of the female bay (``edge" plots), and at the 5m and 400m distances, a plot was placed in the centre of the female bay (``centre" plots).}

    \caption[Path diagram for commodity canola model]{Path diagram for the commodity canola model, with positive and negative terms shown in black and red, respectively. Line thicknesses are proportional to effect size (mean/SD) of coefficients. Coefficients with 95\% posterior quantiles overlapping zero are shown with a transparent line. Interactions are shown as an inverse Y-shaped path, with the two branches representing main effects, and the final branch representing the interaction term (\textit{e.g.} effect of site and year on honey bee visitation rate). Year:site interaction is also shown in Figure \ref{fig:hbeeDist_commodity}. ``Year" indicates the year effect of 2015, and ``Site" indicates the site effect of Grande Prairie.}
