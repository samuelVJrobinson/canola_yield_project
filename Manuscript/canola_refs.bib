  abstract  = {The successful development of 00-oilseed rape—also named canola (erucic acid free in seed oil and low glucosinolate content in the residual seed)—has opened almost unlimited avenues into the food and feed markets. Oilseed rape is today the world's third leading oil crop and contributes both to the economies and health of people around the world. During the last decades, the demand for vegetable oils as food, non-food, and biofuel has grown significantly. This demand could be satisfied due to improved agronomic developments, better processing methods, and improvements in the varieties available. The yield however varies in different countries, reflecting different input levels and production efficiency. This highlights the room for crop improvement, and the yield will continue to be the primary focus of many rapeseed improvement programs. Besides yield and yield stability increasing seed oil content and further improvement of oil and meal qualities have become one of the most important breeding criteria. Modern varieties are based on a relatively small subset of the available genetic diversities. Rapeseed is thus likely to respond strongly to programs aimed at selectively enhancing genetic variation for key economic input and output traits. This review outlines the progress and future challenges for rapeseed breeding.},

  abstract  = {Pollination commonly limits seed production, as addition of pollen to stigmas often increases fecundity. This response is usually interpreted as evidence that plants' stigmas receive too few pollen grains to maximize ovule fertilization (quantity limitation); however, many genetic studies demonstrate that poor-quality pollen can also reduce seed production (quality limitation). We explore both aspects of pollen limitation theoretically with a dose–response model that incorporates a saturating negative-exponential relation of seed production to pollen receipt. This relation depends on aspects of ovule production, pollen import, pollen–pistil interactions and seed development, all of which can contribute to pollen limitation. Our model reveals that quantity limitation is restricted to the lowest range of pollen receipt, for which siring success per pollen grain is high, whereas quality limitation acts throughout the range of pollen receipt if plants do not import the highest-quality pollen. In addition to pollinator availability and efficiency, quantity limitation is governed by all post-pollination aspects of seed production. In contrast, quality limitation depends on the difference in survival of embryos sired by naturally delivered pollen vs. by pollen of maximal quality. We briefly illustrate the distinction between these two components of pollen limitation with results from the mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus. Our model also shows that the standard pollen-supplementation technique neither estimates the total intensity of pollen limitation nor distinguishes between its quantity and quality components. As an alternative, we propose a methodological protocol that requires both measurement of seed production following excess pollination with only outcross pollen and quantification of the dose–response relation of seed output to pollen receipt. This method estimates both the total extent of pollen limitation and its two components. Finally, we consider the influences on quantity and quality limitation, which reveals that quantity limitation probably occurs much less often than has been inferred from pollen-supplementation experiments. These interpretations suggest that an expanded perspective that recognizes the fecundity consequences of pollination with poor-quality pollen would promote ecological understanding of pollen limitation.},

The insect pollinator community was composed of 35 species in 3 orders and 14 families. Most of the bees (Hymenoptera) and a butterfly species (Lepidoptera) foraged for nectar, whereas all the flies (Diptera) foraged either for pollen or both nectar and pollen. Eight major pollinators were tested for their pollination efficiency. The nectar-robbing behavior of many species made it difficult to judge the efficiency of an insect on the basis of visitation rate and stay time; therefore, the amounts of pollen deposited and pollen harvested per visit were also measured. The single visit efficiency in terms of the number of seeds per pod revealed that Apis dorsata, A. florea, and Halictus sp. were superior for canola pollination, having Spears' values of 1.62, 1.55 and 1.73, respectively. With the increase in the number of seeds per pod, seed weight per pod also increased, confirming the importance of these three pollinator species in canola production.},

  abstract  = {Establishing a good canola (rapeseed; Brassica napus L.) stand is difficult in the semiarid prairie region of Canada where low temperature, water stress, and soil crusting could result in poor seed bed conditions. A field study was conducted from 1999 to 2001 at Swift Current, SK, Canada, to determine the effect of a range of uniform (5 to 80 plants m-2) and nonuniform (seedlings from 1-m lengths from two adjoining rows were removed and retained alternatively; 10 to 40 plants m-2) plant populations on yield and yield components of canola. Canola adjusted seed yield across a wide range of plant populations, although it did not compensate completely for the decreasing populations. Environmental conditions played a significant role in the expression of plasticity of canola. For example, in 2000, with slightly above-normal growing season precipitation, canola maintained similar yield levels across a wide range of populations (20 to 80 plants m-2), while in 2001, with well below normal precipitation, seed yield declined as populations dropped below 40 plants m-2 Reducing plant population by half from 80 to 40 plants m-2 did not reduce seed yield when the reduced plant population was uniformly distributed, but reduced yield when the population was nonuniformly distributed. The primary response of canola to lower plant population was increased pods per plant through increased branching and increased pod retention at each node. The number of pods formed on primary and secondary branches increased as population decreased. Seeds per pod and seed weight were stable across populations.},

Yet current evidence does not allow satisfactory assessment of the causes or consequences of pollen limitation. Here, we critically evaluate existing theory and issues concerning pollen limitation. Our main conclusion is that a change in approach is needed to determine whether pollen limitation reflects random fluctuations around a pollen-resource equilibrium, an adaptation to stochastic pollination
environments, or a chronic syndrome caused by an environmental perturbation. We formalize and extend D. Haig and M. Westoby’s conceptual model, and illustrate its use in
guiding research on the evolutionary consequences of pollen limitation, i.e., whether plants evolve or have evolved to ameliorate pollen limitation. This synthesis also reveals that we are only beginning to understand when and how pollen limitation at the plant level translates into effects on plant population dynamics. We highlight the need for both theoretical and empirical approaches to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of life-history characters, Allee effects, and environmental perturbations in population declines mediated by pollen limitation. Lastly, our synthesis identifies a critical need for research on potential effects of pollen limitation at the community and ecosystem levels.},

We used 15 winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) fields in Sweden to study how variation among fields in pollinator visitation rates, pollen beetle attack rates and soil properties (soil texture, pH and organic carbon) interactively determined crop yield. The fields were embedded in a landscape gradient with contrasting proportions of arable and semi-natural land. In general, pollinator visitation and pest levels were negatively correlated and varied independently of soil properties. This may reflect that above- and below-ground processes react at landscape and local spatial scales, respectively. The above-ground biotic interactions and below-ground abiotic factors interactively affected crop yield. Pollinator visitation was the strongest predictor positively associated with yield. High soil pH also benefited yield, but only at lower pest loads. Surprisingly, high pest loads increased the pollinator benefits for yield. Implementing management plans at different spatial scales can create synergies among above- and below-ground ecosystem processes, but both scales are needed given that different processes react at different spatial scales.},

  abstract  = {Background. Up to 75% of crop species benefit at least to some degree from animal pollination for fruit or seed set and yield. However, basic information on the level of pollinator dependence and pollinator contribution to yield is lacking for many crops. Even less is known about how insect pollination affects crop quality. Given that habitat loss and agricultural intensification are known to decrease pollinator richness and abundance, there is a need to assess the consequences for different components of crop production.
Methods. We used pollination exclusion on flowers or inflorescences on a whole plant basis to assess the contribution of insect pollination to crop yield and quality in four flowering crops (spring oilseed rape, field bean, strawberry, and buckwheat) located in four regions of Europe. For each crop, we recorded abundance and species richness of flower visiting insects in ten fields located along a gradient from simple to heterogeneous landscapes.
Results. Insect pollination enhanced average crop yield between 18 and 71% depending on the crop. Yield quality was also enhanced in most crops. For instance, oilseed rape had higher oil and lower chlorophyll contents when adequately pollinated, the proportion of empty seeds decreased in buckwheat, and strawberries’ commercial grade improved; however, we did not find higher nitrogen content in open pollinated field beans. Complex landscapes had a higher overall species richness of wild pollinators across crops, but visitation rates were only higher in complex landscapes for some crops. On the contrary, the overall yield was consistently enhanced by higher visitation rates, but not by higher pollinator richness.
Discussion. For the four crops in this study, there is clear benefit delivered by pollinators on yield quantity and/or quality, but it is not maximized under current agricultural intensification. Honeybees, the most abundant pollinator, might partially compensate the loss of wild pollinators in some areas, but our results suggest the need of landscape-scale actions to enhance wild pollinator populations.},

In an investigation on environmental variation in outcrossing, we estimated the outcrossing rate in the Swedish spring rapeseed cv `Topas' by isozyme analysis and found that outcrossing varied from 12{\%} to 47{\%} over five locations in Sweden, Denmark and Germany. Among flowers at different positions on the same plant, average outcrossing varied from 11{\%} at the top to 39{\%} at the bottom of the plant. In conclusion, environmental factors can greatly influence the outcrossing rate in rapeseed, and an investigation therefore merit further studies.},

Abundance and species richness of pollinating insects were estimated in ten fields of spring oilseed rape, Brassica napus var. SW StratosTM, located along a gradient of landscape compositions ranging from simple landscapes dominated by arable land to heterogeneous landscapes with extensive cover of semi-natural habitats. In each field, we assessed the contribution of wind and insect pollination to seed yield, seed quality (individual seed weight and oil and chlorophyll contents), and market value in a block experiment with four replicates and two treatments: (1) all flowers were accessible to insects, self and wind pollination, and (2) flowers enclosed in tulle net bags (mesh: 1 9 1 mm) were accessible only to wind and self pollination. Complex landscapes enhanced the overall abundance of wild insects as well as the abundance and species richness of hoverflies. This did not translate to a higher yield, probably due to consistent pollination by honey bees across all fields. However, the pollination experiment showed that insects increased seed weight per plant by 18% and market value by 20%. Seed quality was enhanced by insect pollination, rendering heavier seeds as well as higher oil and lower chlorophyll contents, clearly showing that insect pollination is required to reach high seed yield and quality in oilseed rape. Our study demonstrates considerable and previously underestimated contributions from pollinating insects to both the yield and the market value of oilseed rape.},

  abstract  = {The recent trend to place monetary values on ecosystem services has led to studies on the economic importance of pollinators for agricultural crops. Several recent studies indicate regional, long-term pollinator declines, and economic consequences have been derived from declining pollination efficiencies. However, use of pollinator services as economic incentives for conservation must consider environmental factors such as drought, pests, and diseases, which can also limit yields. Moreover, “flower excess” is a well-known reproductive strategy of plants as insurance against unpredictable, external factors that limit reproduction. With three case studies on the importance of pollination levels for amounts of harvested fruits of three tropical crops (passion fruit in Brazil, coffee in Ecuador, and cacao in Indonesia) we illustrate how reproductive strategies and environmental stress can obscure initial benefits from improved pollination. By interpreting these results with findings from evolutionary sciences, agronomy, and studies on wild-plant populations, we argue that studies on economic benefits from pollinators should include the total of ecosystem processes that (1) lead to successful pollination and (2) mobilize nutrients and improve plant quality to the extent that crop yields indeed benefit from enhanced pollinator services. Conservation incentives that use quantifications of nature's services to human welfare will benefit from approaches at the ecosystem level that take into account the broad spectrum of biological processes that limit or deliver the service.},

Reduced gene flow is expected to minimize the impact of genetically engineered (GE) crops on feral and natural populations and to facilitate the coexistence of different agricultural markets. The goal of this study is to link foraging behavior to gene flow and identify behaviors that can help predict gene flow for different bee species. To reach this goal, we first examined and compared the foraging behaviors of three distinct bee species, the European honey bee, Apis mellifera L., the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens Cr., and the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata F., foraging on Medicago sativa flowers. Each foraging behavior investigated differed among bee species. Both social bees exhibited directionality of movement and had similar residence, in contrast to the random movement and shorter residence of the solitary bee. Tripping rate and net distance traveled differed among the three bee species. We ranked each behavior among bee species and used the relative ranking as gene flow predictor before testing the predictions against empirical gene flow data. Tripping rate and net distance traveled, but not residence, predicted relative gene dispersal among bee species. Linking specific behaviors to gene flow provides mechanisms to explain differences in gene flow among bee species and guides the development of management practices to reduce gene flow. Although developed in one system, the approach developed here can be generalized to different plant/pollinator systems.},

  abstract            = {Bateman's principle states that male fitness is usually limited by the number of matings achieved, while female fitness is usually limited by the resources available for reproduction. When applied to flowering plants this principle leads to the expectation that pollen limitation of fruit and seed set will be uncommon. However, if male searching for mates (including pollen dissemination via external agents) is not sufficiently successful, then the reproductive success of both sexes (or both sex functions in hermaphroditic plants) will be limited by number of matings rather than by resources, and Bateman's principle cannot be expected to apply. Limitation of female success due to inadequate pollen receipt appears to be a common phenomenon in plants. Using published data on 258 species in which fecundity was reported for natural pollination and hand pollination with outcross pollen, I found significant pollen limitation at some times or in some sites in 159 of the 258 species (62%). When experiments were performed multiple times within a growing season, or in multiple sites or years, the statistical significance of pollen limitation commonly varied among times, sites or years, indicating that the pollination environment is not constant. There is some indication that, across species, supplemental pollen leads to increased fruit set more often than increased seed set within fruits, pointing to the importance of gamete packaging strategies in plant reproduction. Species that are highly self-incompatible obtain a greater benefit relative to natural pollination from artificial application of excess outcross pollen than do self-compatible species. This suggests that inadequate pollen receipt is a primary cause of low fecundity rates in perennial plants, which are often self-incompatible. Because flowering plants often allocate considerable resources to pollinator attraction, both export and receipt of pollen could be limited primarily by resource investment in floral advertisement and rewards. But whatever investment is made is attraction, pollinator behavioral stochasticity usually produces wide variation among flowers in reproductive success through both male and female functions. In such circumstances the optimal deployment of resources among megaspores, microspores, and pollinator attraction may often require more flowers or more ovules per flower than will usually be fertilized, in order to benefit from chance fluctuations that bring in large number of pollen grains. Maximizing seed set for the entire plant in a stochastic pollination environment might thus entail a packaging strategy for flower number or ovule number per flower that makes pollen limitation of fruit or seed set likely. Pollen availability may limit female success in individual flowers, entire plants (in a season or over a lifetime), or populations. The appropriate level must be distinguished depending on the nature of the question being addressed.},

  abstract  = {Using experimental manipulations, we examined pollen and resource limitations to seed production and their interaction in a natural population of a monocarpic plant, Ipomopsis aggregata. Our design cross two factors, pollen level (hand-pollinated or control) and resource level (water added, water and fertilizer added, or control). Both hand-pollination and fertilizing during the blooming season increased total seed production, while watering alone has no effect on any component of reproductive success. Hand-pollination boosted number of seeds per flower, with no effect on flower number. In contrasts, fertilizing had its primary effect on the number of flowers produced, while also increasing the number of seeds per mature fruit in hand-pollinated plants. Fertilizing increased nectar volume, but path analysis detected no indirect effect of this increased reward rate on seed production, suggesting instead that fertilizing has a slight, but direct, effect on seeds per flower. These results argue against a strict dichotomy between pollen limitation and resource limitation of female reproductive success in plants.},

In this study, we developed protocols to isolate and quantify sugars from larval provision masses. The method removed free amino acids that leach from pollen and confound chromatography, but without autohydrolyzing sucrose. Pollen sugars were a negligible fraction of provision mass sugars. Glucose and fructose constituted about half of the provision fresh weight. Sucrose in alfalfa pollen and nectar is absent from the provision, presumably enzymatically hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose in the provision. Provision masses are composed of two to three times more floral equivalents in pollen than nectar. Female M. rotundata, and other solitary bees with pasty provisions, gather proportionally more pollen than nectar compared with the resource needs of colonies of social honeybees and bumblebees.},

The aim is to achieve the estimation of direct, indirect, and total effects of one variable on another and to assess the adequacy of whole models. Path analytical techniques based on maximum likelihood currently used in ecology are rarely adequate for ecological data, which are often sparse, multi-level, and may contain nonlinear relationships as well as nonnormal response data such as counts or proportion data. Here I introduce a more flexible approach in the form of the joint application of hierarchical Bayes, Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, Shipley's d-sep test, and the potential outcomes framework to fit path models as well as to decompose and estimate effects. An example based on the direct and indirect interactions between ants, two insect herbivores, and a plant species demonstrates the implementation of these techniques, using freely available software.},

  abstract  = {1 Levels of nectar and pollen were manipulated in individual flowers of oil-seed rape, Brassica napus, which were then offered to foraging bumblebees (Bombus lapidarius) for a single visit.
2 The durations of flower visits by bumblebees increased with the amount of nectar, but were unaffected by the level of available pollen. The bees' flower-handling routine may have become behaviourally fixed by the expectation of low pollen rewards, which prevailed in the experimental garden.
3 The effects of nectar provision on both pollen import (deposition on stigma) and export (removal from anthers) were studied. The amount of pollen transferred during a bumblebee's visit was affected only by the amount of pollen that the flower presented.
4 Manipulated flowers that presented a large amount of available pollen received approximately three times more pollen on their stigmas during a bee's visit than flowers with little available pollen, which suggests that autogamous pollen transfer contributes substantially to pollen deposition when pollen availability is high. The gradual dehiscence of the anthers in this species means that available pollen accumulates only if pollinator visits are infrequent, when the increased autogamy may act to ensure adequate pollination.
5 There was no relation between the quantity of nectar residue that a bee left after visiting a manipulated flower and the mean duration of its visits to unmanipulated flowers. Therefore, variation among individuals in the duration of visits to unmanipulated flowers apparently resulted from differences in foraging speed rather than from variation in the thoroughness of nectar removal.},

The most important species of pollinators were social Apidae: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris, B. lucorum, B. cryptarum, and Pyrobombus lapidarius. Honeybees visit the nectaries of canola using 3 different methods. In the "climbing-over" method, after the first nectary, the bee climbed over the style to visit the second. In the "bypassing" method, after the first nectary, the bee went around the style to get to the second nectary. In the "inserting" method, the bee inserted its tongue from the outside of the corolla between the base of the petals (nectar theiving). Only the first method deposited pollen on the stigma. Bumblebees used only the first method.

In the fields provided with hives, honeybees used the second and third foraging methods most frequently, with consequently low pollination. In a single field without hives, bumblebees were more abundant than honeybees, non-aggresive, and used the "climbing-over" method.

The rates of visitation were: 10.6-14 fls/min (Apis mellifera), 32.3 (B. terrestris), 30.5 (B. lucorum), 31.2 (B. cryptarum), 38.6 (P. lapidarius).

In the fields provided with hives, due to unfavorable pollinating behaviour by honeybees, bumblebees appear to be the best pollinator, due to their speed at foraging, and despite their low relative abundance.},

We compare predictions for solitary and social provisioners, and for three foraging currencies. When distinct food patches with identical food parameters are considered, fewer provisioners use the farther patches. The rate of decline in number of provisioners depends on the currency used. With net rate of energy intake (net energy gain over time), the rate of decline is relatively small under a wide range of realistic parameter values and distances; with efficiency (net energy gain over energy cost) and empirically derived energetic costs, the rate of decline is much higher. With lifetime fitness (lifetime food delivery under predation risk), outcomes depend on the ratio of mortality risk during flight and during food collection at the patch. With all currencies, there is a difference between the optimal spatial distribution of solitary and social provisioners, with a larger proportion of social provisioners being farther from the central place. The optimal distribution of solitary provisioners in a two dimensional field of uniformly distributed food such as a flowering meadow is such that the density of solitary provisioners (number per unit area) declines monotonically with distance, and provisioner number peaks at half the maximum area used.},

This article reviews different forms of pollen tube transmitting tracts within the style as well as possibilities for bridging the gap from the transmitting tissue to the ovule. The pollen tube transmitting tissue is the place of possible pollen tube competition. Often the number of pollen grains deposited onto the stigma or stigmata of a flower exceeds the number of ovules in the ovary of the pollinated flower. In the styles of most taxa investigated, a reduction in number of the pollen tubes occurs from the stigma to the ovary (pollen tube attrition): the pollen tubes compete for entry into the embryo sac of the ovules within the ovary. A prediction of the extent of pollen tube competition can be partially equated to the P-S/O ratio. This ratio relates the total number of pollen grains (P) deposited onto the stigmata (S) at the end of the female phase of anthesis (stigma receptivity) to the number of ovules (O) present in the ovary. Some quantitative data on pollen load on the stigma or stigmata and resulting pollen tube competition will be demonstrated especially in the choricarpous gynoecium of Geum rivale (Rosaceae) and in the coenocarpous gynoecium of Cichorium intybus (Asteraceae). Data from this study are compared with data of other taxa obtained from the literature.},

However, large-scale adoption of ecosystem services-based practices in agriculture is lacking, possibly because growers undervalue the benefits of ecosystem services compared to those of conventional management practices. Here we show that, under representative real-world conditions, pollination and plant quality made similar contributions to marketable seed yield of hybrid leek (Allium porrum). Relative to the median, a 25% improvement of plant quality and pollination increased crop value by an estimated $18 007 and $17 174 ha-1 respectively. Across five crop lines, bumblebees delivered most pollination services, while other wild pollinator groups made less frequent but nevertheless substantial contributions. Honeybees actively managed for pollination services did not make significant contributions. Our results show that wild pollinators are an undervalued agricultural input and managing for enhancing pollinators makes sense economically in high-revenue insect-pollinated cropping systems.},

  abstract  = {(1) When foraging on Brussels sprout cultivars with small flowers, nectar-gathering bees preferred to visit the inner nectaries which they approached through the mouths of the flowers. More nectar-gatherers alighted on the outside of flowers of cultivars with deeper corolla tubes and larger floral parts, and inserted their tongues between the perianth segments to reach the outer nectaries, probably because they could not reach the inner nectaries. Bees soon learned to rob flowers and the ease with which they did so, increased as a flower became older and its perianth segments spread apart. Most foragers visiting some cultivars were robbers, particularly at the later stages of flowering. However, some cultivars with small flowers were not robbed even when their flowers were old. 
(2) Flowers were less likely to be pollinated by robber bees than by bees that entered them. Robbing can be discouraged by selecting Brussels sprout cultivars with inner nectaries easily reached by bees and also by increasing the proportion of pollen to nectargatherers visiting the crop. 
(3) In cages, bees did not discriminate between different cultivars, but in an open plot of ten cultivars, different bees preferred different cultivars and some showed considerable constancy to their preferred cultivar. Cultivar preferences may sometimes be associated with nectar availability. The implications of this to the production of hybrid seed are discussed.},

The individual map products include existing global land cover maps such as GlobCover 2005 and MODIS v.5, regional maps such as AFRICOVER and national maps from mapping agencies and other organizations. The different products are ranked at the national level using crowdsourced data from Geo-Wiki to create a map that reflects the likelihood of cropland. Calibration with national and subnational crop statistics was then undertaken to distribute the cropland within each country and subnational unit. The new IIASA-IFPRI cropland product has been validated using very high-resolution satellite imagery via Geo-Wiki and has an overall accuracy of 82.4\%. It has also been compared with the EarthStat cropland product and shows a lower root mean square error on an independent data set collected from Geo-Wiki. The first ever global field size map was produced at the same resolution as the IIASA-IFPRI cropland map based on interpolation of field size data collected via a Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing campaign. A validation exercise of the global field size map revealed satisfactory agreement with control data, particularly given the relatively modest size of the field size data set used to create the map. Both are critical inputs to global agricultural monitoring in the frame of GEOGLAM and will serve the global land modelling and integrated assessment community, in particular for improving land use models that require baseline cropland information.

Significantly more visits were made to male-fertile (MF) rather than cytoplasmically male-sterile (CMS) flowers. Pollen was collected from bees returning to a hive, to determine daily variation in pollen loads collected and to what level the bees were foraging for carrot pollen. Honey bees visited a wide range of alternative pollen sources and made relatively few visits to carrot plants throughout the period of flowering. Visitation rates to other individual floral sources fluctuated but visitation to carrot was consistently low. The underlying rate of carrot pollen visits among collecting trips was modelled and estimated to be as low as 1.4%, a likely cause of the limited success implementing honey bee hives in carrot crops.},

However, consequences for crop yield have been poorly evaluated. Above ground, increased landscape complexity is assumed to enhance biological pest control, whereas below ground, soil organic carbon is a proxy for several yield-supporting services. In a field experiment replicated in 114 fields across Europe, we found that fertilisation had the strongest positive effect on yield, but hindered simultaneous harnessing of below- and above-ground ecosystem services. We furthermore show that enhancing natural enemies and pest control through increasing landscape complexity can prove disappointing in fields with low soil services or in intensively cropped regions. Thus, understanding ecological interdependences between land use, ecosystem services and yield is necessary to promote more environmentally friendly farming by identifying situations where ecosystem services are maximised and agrochemical inputs can be reduced.},

  abstract  = {We studied the reproductive ecology of Clintonia borealis, a clonal understory species, in eastern Ontario. Flowers are protogynous and require insect pollination for outcrossing and maximum seed set. Most pollination is done by nectar-gathering bumble bees. We recorded pollen deposition and flowering patterns in 1983. Flowering lasted for about 10 days in mid-June. Stigmatic pollen loads were lowest at the onset of blooming, reflecting the scarcity of male-phase flowers. Pollination increased significantly by peak bloom and subsequently remained high. However, since bees fly mostly between neighboring stems, much of the pollen transferred may have been geitonogamous. In 1983, seed set per flower was not increased by supplementing pollination or by reducing the number of fruits competing for resources per stem. Rather, flowers set more seeds (14%) only if both treatments were performed simultaneously. Seed size was increased by 25% when competitive fruits were removed and by 5% more when pollen was added under the removal treatment. Further work in 1984 showed that pollination effects may be related to changes in pollen source. Selfed flowers set fewer and smaller seeds than outcrossed ones when screened from insects and hand pollinated. Outcrossing distance had little effect on seed set or seed size. Thus, in C. borealis seed number and seed size are limited by a balance between maternal resource availability and the amount of outcrossing provided by pollinators.},

  abstract  = {There is mounting evidence of pollinator decline all over the world and consequences in many agricultural areas could be significant. We assessed these consequences by measuring 1) the contribution of insect pollination to the world agricultural output economic value, and 2) the vulnerability of world agriculture in the face of pollinator decline. We used a bioeconomic approach, which integrated the production dependence ratio on pollinators, for the 100 crops used directly for human food worldwide as listed by FAO. The total economic value of pollination worldwide amounted to €153 billion, which represented 9.5% of the value of the world agricultural production used for human food in 2005. In terms of welfare, the consumer surplus loss was estimated between €190 and €310 billion based upon average price elasticities of -1.5 to -0.8, respectively. Vegetables and fruits were the leading crop categories in value of insect pollination with about €50 billion each, followed by edible oil crops, stimulants, nuts and spices. The production value of a ton of the crop categories that do not depend on insect pollination averaged €151 while that of those that are pollinator-dependent averaged €761. The vulnerability ratio was calculated for each crop category at the regional and world scales as the ratio between the economic value of pollination and the current total crop value. This ratio varied considerably among crop categories and there was a positive correlation between the rate of vulnerability to pollinators decline of a crop category and its value per production unit. Looking at the capacity to nourish the world population after pollinator loss, the production of 3 crop categories - namely fruits, vegetables, and stimulants - will clearly be below the current consumption level at the world scale and even more so for certain regions like Europe. Yet, although our valuation clearly demonstrates the economic importance of insect pollinators, it cannot be considered as a scenario since it does not take into account the strategic responses of the markets.},

Great strides have been made in the areas of ethylene biosynthesis and response, cell wall metabolism, and environmental factors, such as light, that impact ripening.

This article reviews different forms of pollen tube transmitting tracts within the style as well as possibilities for bridging the gap from the transmitting tissue to the ovule. The pollen tube transmitting tissue is the place of possible pollen tube competition. Often the number of pollen grains deposited onto the stigma or stigmata of a flower exceeds the number of ovules in the ovary of the pollinated flower. In the styles of most taxa investigated, a reduction in number of the pollen tubes occurs from the stigma to the ovary (pollen tube attrition): the pollen tubes compete for entry into the embryo sac of the ovules within the ovary. A prediction of the extent of pollen tube competition can be partially equated to the P-S/O ratio. This ratio relates the total number of pollen grains (P) deposited onto the stigmata (S) at the end of the female phase of anthesis (stigma receptivity) to the number of ovules (O) present in the ovary. Some quantitative data on pollen load on the stigma or stigmata and resulting pollen tube competition will be demonstrated especially in the choricarpous gynoecium of Geum rivale (Rosaceae) and in the coenocarpous gynoecium of Cichorium intybus (Asteraceae). Data from this study are compared with data of other taxa obtained from the literature.},

  abstract  = {Many insects foraging for nectar or pollen exhibit flower constancy, a learned fidelity to a particular species of plant that previously provided a reward. Constancy may persist even when alternative flowers are available that provide a greater or less variable reward. This strategy entails more travelling time than one of generalization (visiting all suitable flowers as they are encountered). The consensus at present is that this increase in travelling time is offset by decreases in handling time; switching between flower species incurs a cost in time spent learning to ‘handle’ the new flower species that is avoided by remaining constant. If this is so, then the optimal strategy should depend upon the density of flower species (and thus the travelling time), with switching occurring below a threshold density of the target flower species. This prediction is tested using the butterfly,Thymelicus flavus, by analysing foraging patterns under natural conditions. This species exhibited constancy: of 465 visits to flowers 85% were to the same species as last visited. As predicted switches between flower species occurred in response to low encounter rates of the flower species on which the individual had previously fed. However, butterflies ignored the vast majority of suitable flowers that they encountered, even when they were of the species to which they were constant. This casts doubt on explanations for flower constancy as an adaptive strategy that minimizes handling time and maximizes resource acquisition per unit time within learning constraints.},

  abstract  = {Structural equation modeling (SEM) is increasingly being chosen by researchers as a framework for gaining scientific insights from the quantitative analyses of data. New ideas and methods emerging from the study of causality, influences from the field of graphical modeling, and advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability, and even purpose of SEM. Guidelines for implementing the expanded capabilities of SEM are currently lacking. In this paper we describe new developments in SEM that we believe constitute a third-generation of the methodology. Most characteristic of this new approach is the generalization of the structural equation model as a causal graph. In this generalization, analyses are based on graph theoretic principles rather than analyses of matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels and causal diagrams, as well as an increased emphasis on queries and probabilistic reasoning, are now included. Estimation under a graph theory framework permits the use of Bayesian or likelihood methods. The guidelines presented start from a declaration of the goals of the analysis. We then discuss how theory frames the modeling process, requirements for causal interpretation, model specification choices, selection of estimation method, model evaluation options, and use of queries, both to summarize retrospective results and for prospective analyses.The illustrative example presented involves monitoring data from wetlands on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia National Park. Our presentation walks through the decision process involved in developing and evaluating models, as well as drawing inferences from the resulting prediction equations. In addition to evaluating hypotheses about the connections between human activities and biotic responses, we illustrate how the structural equation (SE) model can be queried to understand how interventions might take advantage of an environmental threshold to limit Typha invasions.The guidelines presented provide for an updated definition of the SEM process that subsumes the historical matrix approach under a graph-theory implementation. The implementation is also designed to permit complex specifications and to be compatible with various estimation methods. Finally, they are meant to foster the use of probabilistic reasoning in both retrospective and prospective considerations of the quantitative implications of the results.},

  abstract  = {Pollinators are required for producing 15-30% of the human food supply, and farmers rely on managed honey bees throughout the world to provide these services. Yet honey bees are not always the most efficient pollinators of all crops and are declining in various parts of the world. Crop pollination shortages are becoming increasingly common. We found that behavioral interactions between wild and honey bees increase the pollination efficiency of honey bees on hybrid sunflower up to 5-fold, effectively doubling honey bee pollination services on the average field. These indirect contributions caused by interspecific interactions between wild and honey bees were more than five times more important than the contributions wild bees make to sunflower pollination directly. Both proximity to natural habitat and crop planting practices were significantly correlated with pollination services provided directly and indirectly by wild bees. Our results suggest that conserving wild habitat at the landscape scale and altering selected farm management techniques could increase hybrid sunflower production. These findings also demonstrate the economic importance of interspecific interactions for ecosystem services and suggest that protecting wild bee populations can help buffer the human food supply from honey bee shortages.},
  comment   = {Showed that honeybees are more likely to switch from male to female sunflowers in the presence of addtional wild pollinators.

They found a significant, positive association between the number of consecutive years that sunflowers had been planted within 3 km of a field and the amounts of both direct wild bee pollination and enhanced pollination. Probably because of continuity of floral resources within natural habitats (i.e. the wild bees' population increases and stabilizes near areas of consistent food supply).},

The foraging ranges for most bee species are unknown. Foraging distance information is critical for understanding the scale at which bee populations respond to the landscape, assessing the role of bee pollinators in affecting plant population structure, planning conservation strategies for plants, and designing bee habitat refugia that maintain pollination function for wild and crop plants. We used data from 96 records of 62 bee species to determine whether body size predicts foraging distance. We regressed maximum and typical foraging distances on body size and found highly significant and explanatory nonlinear relationships. We used a second data set to: (1) compare observed reports of foraging distance to the distances predicted by our regression equations and (2) assess the biases inherent to the different techniques that have been used to assess foraging distance. The equations we present can be used to predict foraging distances for many bee species, based on a simple measurement of body size.},

Although male gametophyte performance primarily involves cellular processes, an ecological analogy may expose insights into the nature and implications of male gametophyte success. We elaborate this analogy theoretically and present empirical examples that illustrate associated insights. Specifically, we consider pollen loads on stigmas as localised populations subject to density-independent mortality and density-dependent processes as they traverse complex stylar environments. Different combinations of the timing of pollen-tube access to limiting stylar resources (simultaneous or sequential), the tube distribution among resources (repulsed or random) and the timing of density-independent mortality relative to competition (before or after) create signature relations of mean pollen-tube success and its variation among pistils to pollen receipt. Using novel nonlinear regression analyses (two-moment regression), we illustrate contrasting relations for two species, demonstrating that variety in these relations is a feature of reproductive diversity among angiosperms, rather than merely a theoretical curiosity. Thus, the details of male gametophyte ecology should shape sporophyte reproductive success and hence the dynamics and structure of angiosperm populations.},

  abstract  = {Differences in the foraging behavior of B. terricola workers on white clover, Trifolium repens, were examined on previously unvisited (filled) and depleted flowers, and as a function of flower-head density.

1. The number of florets visited per unit time was independent of flower head density from 20 to at least 290 heads/m2, in part because the bees utilized more florets per head at low flower head densities, and also because they approached but rejected more flower heads at high rather than at low flower head densities.

2. Previously visited clover-heads were approached but often rejected, while unvisited heads were not rejected.

3. The bees behaved markedly different while foraging in patches of flowers which were available to all foragers, than in those which had been screened and contained on the average 3.9 times more sugar; they tendent to move through depleted areas and to concentrate in rich areas. On successive flower-head visits in depleted areas they moved more forward than backward (82% vs. 18%), while in rich areas they tended to move almost as much backward as forward 47% vs. 53%).

4. The distances of inter-head moves were approximately twice as long in depleted as in rich areas.

5. The bees visited almost as many florets per unit time in the rich as in the depleted areas (32 vs. 35 per min). But in the rich patches they probed on the average into 11.6 florets per head in contrast to only 2.3 florets per depleted head.

6. In an experiment with B. vagans workers foraging from Aconitum napellus inflorescences, the bees did not reject previously visited flowers, and they moved upward in successive flower visits on inverted as well as on unaltered inflorescences. On horizontal inflorescences they moved both right and left. The movements are not a direct response to nectar differences, nor to differences in average nectar distributions. The systematic foraging behavior on vertical inflorescences may thus be a mechanism of reducing the revisiting of just-emptied flowers.},

I considered frequency of pollen transfer, number of pollen grains deposited on the stigma, selection of floral sexual stage (flowers are markedly, protandrous), and patterns of flight distance between flowers. Hymenoptera deposited more pollen and more often than Lepidoptera or Diptera. The latter two groups did not differ in this respect. Interspecific variation in frequency of pollen delivery depended on differences in proportional visitation to female-stage (receptive) flowers as well as total pollen delivery to these flowers. Lepidoptera tended to fly longer distances between consecutive flowers than Hymenoptera. Hand-pollination experiments demonstrate that variation among floral visitors in reproductive services rendered may translate into differential fitness of L. latifolia plants. Nevertheless, the potential for plant specialization on specific insects is constrained by counterbalancing variation in components of pollination quality.},

  abstract  = {Cross-pollination from fields of transgenic crops is of great public concern. Although cross-pollination in commercial canola (Brassica napus) fields has been empirically measured, field trials are expensive and do not identify the causes of cross-pollination. Therefore, theoretical models can be valuable because they can provide estimates of crosspollination at any given site and time. We present a general analytical model of field-to-field gene flow due to the following competing mechanisms: the wind, bees, and autonomous pollination. We parameterize the model for the particular case of field-to-field crosspollination of genetically modified (GM) canola via the wind and via bumble bees (Bombus s) and honey bees (Apis mellifera). We make extensive use of the large data set of bee densities collected during the recent U.K. Farm Scale Evaluations. We predict that canola approaches almost full seed set without pollinators and that autonomous pollination is responsible for >25% of seed set, irrespective of pollinator abundance. We do not predict the relative contribution of bees vs. the wind in landscape-scale gene flow in canola. However, under model assumptions, we predict that the maximum field-to-field gene flow due to bumble ees is 0.04% and 0.13% below the current EU limit for adventitious GM presence for winterand spring-sown canola, respectively. We predict that gene flow due to bees is ~3.1 times higher at 20% compared to 100% male-fertility, and due to the wind, 1.3 times higher at 20% compared to 100% male-fertility, for both winter- and spring-sown canola. Bumblebee mediated gene flow is ~2.7 times higher and wind-mediated gene flow ~1.7 times lower in spring-sown than in winter-sown canola, regardless of the degree of male-sterility. The model of cross-pollination due to the wind most closely predicted three previously published observations: field-to-field gene flow is low; gene flow increases with the proportion of plants that are male-sterile; and gene flow is higher in winter- than in spring-sown canola. Our results therefore suggest that the wind, not bees, is the main vector of long-distance gene flow in canola.},

  abstract  = {Winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is an important crop for human consumption and biofuel production and its production is increasing worldwide. It is generally assumed that cross-pollination by insects increases oilseed rape yield but testing of this has been restricted to a few rapeseed varieties and produced varying results. The present study determines whether cross-pollination benefits a number of oilseed rape varieties by comparing yield in the presence and absence of insects. Four rapeseed varieties (Sherlock, Traviata, Treffer and Visby) were used with ten individuals each in four pollination treatments: (1) supplementary hand-pollination, (2) open pollination with insects able to access the flowers, (3) wind pollination and (4) autonomous self-pollination. Across all four varieties, open and supplementary hand-pollination treatments resulted in higher fruit set, numbers of seeds per pod and seed yield compared with wind and self-pollination. The cross-pollination benefits, however, differed among rapeseed varieties: Treffer and Visby had a higher dependence on open (insects) and supplementary crosspollination than Sherlock and Traviata. Across all four varieties, seed weight compensated for reduced fruit set and was highest when plants were self-pollinated. The present results highlight the importance of considering varietal differences in crop pollination research. Information on the pollination requirements of crop varieties is required by farmers to optimize management decisions in a world of increasing agropollination deficits.},

  abstract  = {1. Plantings of pollinator-dependent crops vary from large, intensively managed fields to small fields that are managed less intensively, yet there is relatively little information on how pollinator populations and their contribution to crop productivity vary across this gradient.
2. We determined the relative importance of wild bees and managed honey bees Apis mellifera L. for crop pollination in the blueberry Vaccinium corymbosum L. system of Michigan, USA, by comparing bee communities in small, isolated blueberry fields with those in large blueberry fields (stocked with managed honey bee hives) and measuring the difference in yields of open-pollinated and pollinator-excluded clusters of flowers. We combined these assessments to calculate the contribution of bees to crop production in this system.
3. Wild bees were the dominant pollinators in small fields, comprising 58% of flower-visiting bees, whereas 97% of bees in large fields were honey bees. Large fields had four times as many bees visiting flowers than small fields, but only one-tenth as many bumble bees as small fields.
4. Levels of fruit set exceeded 85% in all fields and were similar between field sizes. Berry weight increased with flower exposure to pollinators and was positively correlated with bee abundance. Berry weights from open-pollinated flowers were twice as high in large fields compared with small fields.
5. By combining berry weight increases attributable to honey bees and wild bees in blueberry fields with measurements of the bee community adjusted for pollinator efficiency, we calculated the relative contributions of honey bees and wild bees to pollination of Michigan blueberries. We estimate that wild bees provide 82% of the pollination in small fields but only 12% of the total pollination services across this system, mostly through their secondary role in large fields.
6. Synthesis and applications. Wild bees are the primary pollinators of small blueberry fields, but these insects are at low abundance in large fields, perhaps due to a lack of nesting resources or competition for resources with honey bees. Our findings highlight the dependence of commercial fruit producers on honey bees and suggest that increasing the pollination contribution of other bees, particularly bumble bees, in large fields will require that growers adopt wild bee conservation strategies or stock their fields with managed colonies. Quantifying the contributions of managed and wild pollinating bees across the range of crop production scenarios will help to direct development of integrated crop pollination strategies to minimize the risk of pollination deficits affecting food production.},

  abstract = {The growth and reproductive schedule of terrestrial plants can be usefully studied as the dynamic optimal allocation of material between different organs. This idea, pioneered by Dan Cohen, has been formalized as an optimal control problem and analysed using Pontryagin’s maximum principle or dynamic programming. Here, I review several examples of dynamic resource allocation models. First, the seasonal timing of reproduction of annuals is discussed. This can be extended to plants with multiple vegetative organs and the optimal shoot–root balance is assessed. Secondly, the growth schedule over multiple seasons is examined, and the reproductive effort, the leaf phenology of deciduous perennials, and the conditions under which perenniality is more advantageous than annuality are considered. With some modifications, the same model can handle intermittent reproduction and monocarpic perennials (one large reproduction after many years). Thirdly, growth in an unpredictably fluctuating environment is analysed for the case in which a sudden disturbance (herbivory or fire) removes the photosynthetic system altogether, followed by recovery using stored material, and for the case in which environmental productivity fluctuates in a Markovian process. Finally, the optimal level of chemical defence against herbivory is formalized and used to explain the intensity of alkaloid defence decreasing with leaf age. These examples illustrate the usefulness of dynamic resource allocation models in understanding plant life-history adaptation.},

However, most studies on this issue focus on bees, while other invertebrate taxa are largely ignored. We investigated the pollination efficiency of the globally abundant hover fly Episyrphus balteatus on the common crop, oilseed rape (Brassica napus). The study was conducted over a period of 2 consecutive years by means of enclosure experiments at an agricultural site located in Central Hesse (Germany). E. balteatus significantly increased both seed set and yield. This effect was very constant in the 2 years, despite considerable interannual differences in total seed numbers and seed mass. It highlights the important role of hover flies as pollinators of arable crops under varying environmental conditions. In contrast to bees, the effect of E. balteatus was lower at high pollinator densities than at low pollinator densities. This suggests adverse effects of density-dependent factors on pollination efficiency at high densities. Thus, models ignoring the modulating effect of biotic interactions by generally assuming a simple positive relationship between pollinator density and pollination efficiency might not apply to a vital component of the pollinator community.},

-High densities had lower seed-set than low densities. They attribute this to changes to long-distance foraging strategies at high density.},

Accumulated DD (base temperature = 15 °C) were recorded for each field and divided into four equal periods within fields. Native and honey bee visitation was monitored every 2 d by counting the numbers observed per 100 flowers on the A-line. All cotton bolls were hand harvested and sorted by date of bloom. Following harvesting, ginning, and delinting, seeds were counted and weighed, and percent germination was determined. Although the native and honey bee visitation level was adequate throughout each DD period, linear regression analyses indicate that coefficients of determination (r2) were low for (i) percent boll set and number of bees (native and honey bees), and (ii) number of seeds per boll and mean number of bees (native and honey bees). Pollination during the earlier DD periods resulted in higher percent germination, larger number of seeds per boll, and higher seed weight than seeds resulting from pollination during the latter bloom periods. We conclude that with proper honey bee management and pollination timing, the quality of hybrid seed produced will be improved by using only that from the first half of the bloom period},

In particular, we examine the role of recent ecological perturbations in influencing pollen limitation and discuss the relation between pollen limitation and plant traits.

Previous reviews of pollen supplementation experiments concluded that a majority of plant species suffers from pollen limitation and that its magnitude is high. Here, we perform a meta-analysis and find evidence that publication bias, experimental design, and the response variable chosen all influence the magnitude of pollen limitation. Fail-safe numbers indicate that publication bias exists for some measures of pollen limitation; significant results are more likely to be published and therefore available for review. Moreover, experiments conducted on only a fraction of a plant's flowers and reproductive episodes report ~8-fold higher effect sizes than those on all flowers produced over the entire lifetime, likely because resource reallocation among flowers and across years contributes to estimates of pollen limitation. Studies measuring percentage fruit set report higher values of pollen limitation than those measuring other response variables, such as seeds per fruit, perhaps because many plant species will not produce fruits unless adequate pollen receipt occurs to fertilize most ovules. We offer suggestions for reducing the bias introduced by methodology in pollen supplementation experiments and discuss our results in the context of optimality theory.},

  abstract  = {The effect of pollen addition and reduction on the fruit and seed production of ground cherry (Physalis longifolia) plants was examined experimentally in the field over an entire flowering season. Pollen levels were manipulated for entire plants by augmenting natural pollination with hand-pollinations and reducing natural pollination by taping half of the flowers closed. These manipulations make it possible to determine if plants are simultaneously resource and pollen limited, a condition that suggests the plant is maximizing seed production given the resources available for female reproduction. Effects of pollen manipulation were dependent on the size of the plant. Large plants responded to reduced pollination by increasing flower produc- tion and the number of seeds per fruit; as a result, total seed production did not differ from that of large control plants. In contrast, small plants showed no change in response to reduced pollination, yet seed production did not differ significantly from that of controls, as seed produc- tion in both groups was low. Large hand-pollinated plants did not differ significantly from large control plants in any components of yield. In contrast, small hand-pollinated plants had significantly higher percentage fruit set and produced significantly more fruit and seeds than did small control plants. Differences in seed production reflected different proportions of plants that set some rather than no fruit. This may result from low pollinator visitation rates to small plants with small floral displays. Experimental results for large plants are only consistent with the hypothesis that large plants are simultaneously resource and pollen limited. To the extent that there is a trade-off between flower production and seed provisioning, large P. Iongifolia plants are allocating resources so as to maximize maternal seed production. In contrast, small plants are only pollen limited},

One such tool that has gained significant traction in the biological sciences is structural equation models (SEM), a form of path analysis that resolves complex multivariate relationships among a suite of interrelated variables.
2. Evaluation of SEMs has historically relied on covariances among variables, rather than the values of the data points themselves. While this approach permits a wide variety of model forms, it limits the incorporation of detailed specifications. Recent developments have allowed for the simultaneous implementation of non-normal distributions, random effects and different correlation structures using local estimation, but this process is not yet automated and consequently, evaluation can be prohibitive with complex models.
3. Here, I present a fully documented, open-source package piecewiseSEM, a practical implementation of confirmatory path analysis for the r programming language. The package extends this method to all current (generalized) linear, (phylogenetic) least-square, and mixed effects models, relying on familiar r syntax. I also provide two worked examples: one involving random effects and temporal autocorrelation, and a second involving phylogenetically independent contrasts.
4. My goal is to provide a user-friendly and tractable implementation of SEM that also reflects the ecological and methodological processes generating data.},

The model provides a reasonable fit to the observed data, and the two species do not differ significantly with regard to the parameter estimates. Inflorescence number and capsule number have large significant effects on fitness, but the effect of number of seeds per capsule is not significant. Leaf areas during midlife influence fitness indirectly via production of reproduction structures; during late—life they have a direct effect on fitness via seed filling. The analysis of fitness components using the method of structural equation model fills an intermediary role between simple morphometric analysis and more explicit modelling of physiological processes.},

A third factor was also included, testing whether different cultivars responded differently to the tested factors. Insect pollination was required to reach high yield and seed quality (oil content). Final benefits of pollination service were, however, greatly modified by cultivar, where the seed yield of the open-pollinated cultivar largely depended on insect pollination whereas the two hybrid cultivars did not. A near significant interaction between nitrogen input and insect pollination was also found, i.e. benefits to crop yield from insect pollination seemed to increase with decreased nitrogen levels. The differential response of the three cultivars suggested opportunities to use cultivars that are less dependent on insect pollination in landscapes where this service has been deteriorated. Increased access of nitrogen seems to partly compensate yield losses from poor insect pollination. Integrating conservation, environmental and agronomic sciences is therefore crucial to sustain agriculture productions through optimized management of agronomic inputs and biodiversity-based ecosystem services.},

Under competitive conditions, the weight of sown seeds is positively correlated phenotypically with final plant stature, lifetime flower production, lifetime fruit production, and seed production. To establish the evolutionary significance of seed-weight variation in a natural population, I conducted reciprocal crosses among individuals chosen from a wild population in Connecticut. The progeny were sown in an experimental garden, and an analysis of 12 life history and fitness components was conducted on the paternal half sibs. This design provided estimates of the narrow-sense and broad-sense heritabilities of the weight of sown seeds (produced by the parental generation), germination and flowering dates, 7 fitness components, the weight of seeds produced by F$_1$ adults, and lifetime maternal fecundity. The results suggest that natural selection could not operate to effect evolutionary change in seed weight in this experimental population. Maternal environmental effects, non-additive genetic effects, and/or developmental sources of variation are largely responsible for the phenotypic variance in seed weight in wild radish. Additive genetic variance was detected in several life history and fitness components, suggesting that additive genetic variance in total fitness exists within this population.},

First, ecosystem (wild) pollination services remain largely bundled with those of managed pollinators. This problem is compounded by the fact that the dependency of crops on pollination, a key parameter used in current valuations, does not reflect variation in pollinator density, crop cultivars and growing conditions that exist in practice. Over half of the €153 billion of estimated global pollination service value in 2005 is based on estimates of pollinator dependency from crops with fewer than three field studies that measure actual levels of pollinator activity and corresponding fruit set. The resulting uncertainty may be most distorting when applied to widely-planted intensive oilseed crops. Furthermore, current valuations are underpinned by simplistic assumptions regarding the likelihood of pollinator decline and the impact on agricultural prices. Although efforts to motivate wild pollinator protection through their ecosystem service value remain highly circumscribed by conceptual and empirical limitations, we identify the need to go beyond technical solutions and develop a critical framework that could account for why pollinator conservation has come to be predominantly justified in these terms to begin with.},

  abstract  = {Promising performances of winter and spring oilseed rape have drawn attention to the interest of F1 hybrid varieties (Lefort-Buson & Datte 1985; Sernyk 1983). Amongst different sources of male cytoplasmic sterility currently under study (CMS, Rousselle 1981) is a CMS derived from radish (Ogura 1968; Bannerot et al 1983), improved by protoplast fusion (cybrids obtained by Pelletier et al 1983). However, because of difficulties encountered in selection of restorer lines (Pellan-Delourme 1986) the possibility of exploiting male sterility without fertility restoration in the hybrid F1 is being considered. One way of doing this is to use a `mixed' variety, in which F1 hybrid male-steriles obtained from cybrids mentioned above are exploited as `females', with male-fertile pollinisers, in a given proportion. Yield in such a mixture would be assured by the hybrid F1, the 'male' plants serving as pollen source. However, by-passing the problem of fertility restoration in cybrids in this way raises fresh problems. These make it necessary to examine the significance of factors affecting pollination, notably the role of bees, and of those involved in competition, in order to determine the type of male-fertile oilseed to be used, and the most appropriate proporation of fertile plants in the mixtures. As a first step work has begun using a same line of spring ra, in its male-fertile (`male') and male-sterile (`female') forms. Results of tests undertaken in 1985 are described here.},

Pollination deficit (the difference between potential and actual pollination) and bee abundance were measured in organic, conventional, and herbicide-resistant, genetically modified (GM) canola fields (Brassica napus and B. rapa) in northern Alberta, Canada, in the summer of 2002. Bee abundance data were collected using pan traps and standardized sweep netting, and pollination deficit was assessed by comparing the number of seeds per fruit from openpollinated and supplementally pollinated flowers. There was no pollination deficit in organic fields, a moderate pollination deficit in conventional fields, and the greatest pollination deficit in GM fields. Bee abundance was greatest in organic fields, followed by conventional fields, and lowest in GM fields. Overall, there was a strong, positive relationship between bee abundance at sampling locations and reduced pollination deficits. Seed set in B. napas increased with greater bee abundance. Because B. rapa is an obligate outcrossing species, the lack of pollination deficit in the organic (B. rapa) fields likely was due to the high bee abundance rather than a lower dependence of B. rapa on pollinators than B. napus canola. Our study illustrates the importance of wild bees to agricultural production and suggests that some agroecosystems may better sustain wild bee abundance, resulting in greater seed production. Further research on why some cropping systems, such as genetically modified, herbicide-resistant canola, have low wild bee abundance would be useful for management of agroecosystems to promote sustainability of food production.},

The permeability of bags to wind-borne pollen may have important consequences in studies of pollination and reproductive biology. The permeability of four fabrics commonly used in the construction of pollination bags was examined.
Methods: Deposition of wind-borne pollen on horizontally and vertically oriented microscope slides was assessed on slides enclosed in pollination bags, as well as on control slides.
Key Results: It was found that the permeability of fabrics to wind-borne pollen, as measured by deposition on both horizontally and vertically oriented slides, decreased with pore size. However, deposition on horizontal slides was always greater than on vertical slides for a given fabric; this could manifest itself as differential success of pollination of flowers in bags—dependent on flower orientation.
Conclusions: Obviously, bags with mesh size smaller than most pollen grains are impermeable to pollen. However, material for such bags is very expensive. In addition, it was also observed that bags with even moderately small pore size, such as pores (approx. 200 µm) in twisted fibre cotton muslin, offered highly significant barriers to passage of wind-borne pollen. Such bags are sufficiently effective in most large-sample-size reproductive biology studies.},

Background and Aims
Timing of reproduction is a key life-history trait that is regulated by resource availability. Delayed reproduction in soils with low phosphorus availability is common among annuals, in contrast to the accelerated reproduction typical of other low-nutrient environments. It is hypothesized that this anomalous response arises from the high marginal value of additional allocation to root growth caused by the low mobility of phosphorus in soils.
Methods

To better understand the benefits and costs of such delayed reproduction, a two-resource dynamic allocation model of plant growth and reproduction is presented. The model incorporates growth, respiration, and carbon and phosphorus acquisition of both root and shoot tissue, and considers the reallocation of resources from senescent leaves. The model is parameterized with data from Arabidopsis and the optimal reproductive phenology is explored in a range of environments.
Key Results

The model predicts delayed reproduction in low-phosphorus environments. Reproductive timing in low-phosphorus environments is quite sensitive to phosphorus mobility, but is less sensitive to the temporal distribution of mortality risks. In low-phosphorus environments, the relative metabolic cost of roots was greater, and reproductive allocation reduced, compared with high-phosphorus conditions. The model suggests that delayed reproduction in response to low phosphorus availability may be reduced in plants adapted to environments where phosphorus mobility is greater.
Conclusions

Delayed reproduction in low-phosphorus soils can be a beneficial response allowing for increased acquisition and utilization of phosphorus. This finding has implications both for efforts to breed crops for low-phosphorus soils, and for efforts to understand how climate change may impact plant growth and productivity in low-phosphorus environments.},

  abstract  = {Insects contribute to the pollination of about 75% of crop species. Among such insect-pollinated crops, oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is increasingly cultivated worldwide. However, the degree to which seed set in B. napus depends on insect pollination is still under debate. To compare research approaches for estimating pollinator dependency, we reviewed the relevant literature published between 1956 and 2018. The majority of the studies were conducted in Europe (75%) on winter cultivars (77%) and monitored honeybees (52%). Our main findings are: (1) Dependency on insect pollination differs among cultivars and regions. (2) Field observations provide more realistic and comparable results than observations on caged plants. (3) Field conditions, soil nutrient availability, and pest management practices all influence insect dependency and subsequent yield. (4) Plot size conditions pollinator behaviour, as pollination success can be related to insect density or diversity depending on the size of the plot. (5) Insect numbers vary according to the observation distances within a field. (6) Comparison between studies is complicated by the use of different proxies to assess final yield, which may not be equivalent. We provide several recommendations to improve the reliability of future studies of oilseed rape pollination and of insect pollination dependency such as choosing open field observations compared to bag, cage or greenhouse studies, registering field conditions (pests, pesticides, fertilisation level) and defining yield as total seeds per plant to take into consideration compensation mechanisms.},

Species with corbiculae, such as honey or bumble bees, compress grains into dense pellets borne on the hind tibiae. Other species sweep grains into local concentrations of hairs (scopae), typically around the legs (in Halictidae and Andrenidae) or the ventral abdomen (Megachilidae), in which grains remain loose. Do these modes of pollen packing affect the functional value of pollen? We transferred grains from the bodies of four groups of bees—the corbiculate bees: Bombus impatiens and Apis mellifera, and the non-corbiculate bees: Megachile rotundata and Halictus spp.—onto previously unvisited stigmas of Brassica rapa. We wiped corbicular or scopal pollen and body pollen from each bee’s body separately and measured the resulting fruit set and the number of seeds in successful fruits. The type of pollen significantly affected the number of fruits for the corbiculate bee species but not the non-corbiculate bees, and the type of pollen significantly affected the number of seeds in successful fruits for A. mellifera but not B. impatiens, M. rotundata, or Halictus spp. These results suggest that loose scopal pollen is fully functional, but corbicular pollen is sometimes impaired. In some situations, non-corbiculate bees may be more valuable pollinators than corbiculate species because their treatment of pollen leaves its capabilities intact.},

  abstract = {Oilseed rape (OSR, Brassica napus L.) is a common crop found in many European agricultural landscapes. It is pollinated by a wide variety of insects, but the reported contribution of pollinators to yield varies widely between studies (from 0 to 50%). Moreover, such a contribution has seldom been estimated at the field scale in real farming conditions. We analysed OSR yields in response to insect pollination; over four years, at two different scales: farm fields and individual plants. We used both empirical and experimental approaches along a gradient of pollinator diversity and abundance. The empirical approach was based on farm surveys (151 fields) while the experimental approach used various pollination exclusion methods (570 plants in 101 fields) to estimate the relative contributions of insect, wind, and self-pollination. The OSR yields were positively correlated to total bee abundance and bee genera diversity, through improved fruiting success and plant seed mass (after adjusting for plant biomass). Hoverfly diversity and abundance, and bumblebee abundance did not have any effect. The main OSR pollinators in our study were honeybees (Apis mellifera) and wild bees (Lasioglossum spp.). Yields were increased, on average, by up to 37.5% (27.7% – 47.5%) at field scale when bee genera diversity increased from a single genus to more than 10 genera (pan-trap data). Insect pollination contributed about 30% of plant yield. Self-pollination and wind pollination accounted for the remaining 70%, with self-pollination being the major contributor. Our study demonstrates that pollinator diversity and abundance, at least at very high levels, have a major effect on OSR yields. This suggests that establishing a monetary value for pollination services in OSR farming systems could be used to balance the cost of managing semi-natural habitats or meadows to maintain bees and other pollinators.},

Changing sex allocation because of changing payoffs may result from different ecological situations, such as foraging conditions. We investigated the impact of foraging travel cost on relative investment in sons vs daughters. Field studies were carried out with the central-place-foraging leafcutter bee Megachile rotundata (Fabricius), which has smaller males than females. Therefore, less investment is required to produce a viable son compared with a daughter. We found that with increased flight distance to resources, females produced a greater proportion of sons. Females also invested fewer resources in individual sons and daughters and produced fewer offspring with increased flight distance.},

The fruit and seed set per not-empty pod of 5 MS plants bagged under gauze to avoid bee visits were 7 times and 3.4 times higher, respectively, in the cages with honeybees than in control cages without honeybees.

Because native species pollinate many of these crops effectively, conserving habitats for wild pollinators within agricultural landscapes can help maintain pollination services. Using hierarchical Bayesian techniques, we synthesize the results of 23 studies - representing 16 crops on five continents - to estimate the general relationship between pollination services and distance from natural or semi-natural habitats. We find strong exponential declines in both pollinator richness and native visitation rate. Visitation rate declines more steeply, dropping to half of its maximum at 0.6 km from natural habitat, compared to 1.5 km for richness. Evidence of general decline in fruit and seed set - variables that directly affect yields - is less clear. Visitation rate drops more steeply in tropical compared with temperate regions, and slightly more steeply for social compared with solitary bees. Tropical crops pollinated primarily by social bees may therefore be most susceptible to pollination failure from habitat loss. Quantifying these general relationships can help predict consequences of land use change on pollinator communities and crop productivity, and can inform landscape conservation efforts that balance the needs of native species and people.},

Nine varieties with different reported maturities (winter and spring types) were sown at either two times of sowing and/or under different nitrogen (N) fertiliser regimes. Dates of key phenological development were recorded, dry matter was determined at bud, flowering and maturity and grain yield and yield components were determined at harvest. Plant traits and climate data were assessed in relation to grain yield. Yields of the winter types were either significantly (P<0.05) greater or not significantly less than the spring types in all 3 years and similar to those reported under experimental conditions in Europe. This was despite the winter types flowering up to 35 days later than the spring types and spring rainfall being approximately half that of the long-term average. In general, the winter types had greater early vigour, greater dry matter production at the bud, flowering and maturity stages and were taller than the spring types. Regression analysis showed positive relationships between grain yield and pod density and plant size (dry matter and plant height). Plant size was influenced by variety, time of sowing and N fertiliser application rates. Crops in the HRZ were able to sustain more seeds per pod at larger canopy sizes and pod densities than those achieved in the northern hemisphere. Despite the number of pods per g of dry matter at flowering being nearly double that reported in the UK, there was little apparent reduction in the number of seeds per pod. It is possible that higher solar radiation and warmer minimum temperatures in the HRZ of Australia provide conditions more favourable for growth before, and during grainfill. This indicates that different dry matter production and yield component targets may be appropriate for canola in this environment especially in more typical seasons. It is likely that growers will need to sow new, later maturing varieties earlier and with higher rates of N fertiliser than is current practice in Australia. This study indicates that winter types may have the potential to provide improvements to the yield of canola in the HRZ either through the direct importation of varieties from overseas or through the identification and incorporation of desired traits into existing material. It is recommended that a wider range of germplasm be assessed over a greater geographical area to identify traits and management practices to optimise phenology and canopy structure. This information can be used to help inform breeders on crop improvement priorities as well providing tailored management practices to maximise grain yields for this environment.},

indicated that crop productivity increases as a result of honey bee Apis mellifera L. pollination. Given this
crop’s growing importance in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, this work evaluated the increase in pod and seed
productivity with respect to interactions with anthophilous insects and manual pollination tests. The visiting
frequency of A. mellifera was correlated with the crop’s blooming progression, and productivity comparisons
were made between plants visited by insects, manually pollinated plants (geitonogamy and xenogamy) and
plants without pollination induction. Pod set and seed production per plant were determined for each treatment.
Among the 8,624 recorded flower-visiting insects, Hymenoptera representatives were the most prevalent
(92.3%), among which 99.8% were A. mellifera. The correlation between these bees and blooming progression
was positive (r = 0.87; p = 0.002). Pollination induction increased seed productivity from 28.4% (autogamy)
to 50.4% with insect visitations, as well as to 48.7 (geitonogamy) and to 55.1% (xenogamy) through manual
pollination.},

  abstract  = {The aim of this study was to determine if and how the honeybee reduces the blooming period of canola (Brassica napus). Colonies were installed in different fields of canola in the Chaudiere-Appalaches (two replicates) and Quebec City (one replicate) regions to create a density gradient of zero to three colonies per hectare. To calculate the blooming period under these conditions, 10 labelled plants were caged in the field, out of the reach of pollinators, and 10 others were labelled in the field and exposed to foragers. The number of flowers found on each plant was recorded daily. This study also aims at demonstrating that the canola plant will produce new flowers as long as it does not reach its maximum carrying capacity, thereby extending the blooming period. To simulate the fall of unfertilized flowers, a predetermined number of flowers from 20 randomly selected plants in one of the replicates were cut off every day. The plant, when it reaches its maximum carrying capacity, stops producing new flowers. With three colonies per hectare, the blooming period was reduced by 3.8 days, or 17 % compared with in the absence of pollinators. Because of the efficient pollen transfer to the stigma, the honeybees do not only cause the flower to live for a shorter period of time, but they also bring about a decrease in the number of flowers produced by the plant, thereby reducing the duration of blooming period.},

It is achieved with the assistance of various pollen vectors, but particularly by the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. Although the importance of pollination has been shown for the production of seed crops, the need to introduce bee hives in canola fields during flowering to increase oil seed yield has not yet been proven. With the purpose of showing this, hives of A. mellifera were grouped and placed in various canola fields in the Chaudiere-Appalaches and Capitale-Nationale regions (nine fields; three blocks with three treatments; 0, 1.5, and 3 hives per hectare). A cage was used to exclude pollinators and bee visitations were observed in each field. After the harvest, yield analyses were done in relation to the bee density gradient created, by using pod set, number of seeds per plant, and weight of 1000 seeds. Results showed an improvement in seed yield of 46% in the presence of three honey bee hives per hectare, compared with the absence of hives. The introduction of honey bees contributed to production and consequently, these pollinators represented a beneficial and important pollen vector for the optimal yield of canola.},

  abstract  = {Globally, agriculture increasingly depends on pollinators to produce many seed and fruit crops. However, what constitutes optimal pollination service for pollinator-dependent crops remains unanswered. We developed a simulation model to identify the optimal pollination service that maximizes fruit quality in crops. The model depicts the pollination (i.e., autonomous self-fertilization, pollen deposition) and post-pollination (i.e., pollen germination, and time from germination to ovule fertilization) processes leading to fruit and seed set and allows for negative flower–pollinator interactions, specifically pistil damage. We parameterized and validated the model based on empirical observations of commercial raspberry in western Argentina. To assess the effects of pollination intensity for fruit production, we conducted simulations over a range of visit number per flower by the two primary managed pollinators worldwide, Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris. Simulations identified that ~15–35 visits per flower by A. mellifera or ~10–20 visits by B. terrestris provide adequate pollination and maximize raspberry fruit quality (i.e., estimated as the proportion of ovules that develop into drupelets). Visits in excess of these optima reduce simulated fruit quality, and flowers receiving >670 honey bee visits or >470 bumble bee visits would produce fruits of poorer quality than those receiving no bee visits. The simulations generated consistent, unbiased predictions of fruit quality for 12 raspberry fields. This model could be adapted easily to other animal-pollinated crops and used to guide efficient pollinator management in any agro-ecosystem.},

Multiple pollinators often visit plants and can vary in visitation rates, pollen removal and deposition, and spatial and temporal distribution, altering plant reproduction and patterns of pollinator-mediated selection. Although some visitors may not be effective pollinators, pollinator effectiveness is rarely estimated directly as seed set resulting from a single visit by each taxon visiting generalist plants. For two years, effectiveness of visitors to wild radish, Raphanus raphanistrum, was quantified by counting seeds set and pollen grains removed as a result of a single visit. We calculated a pollinator's importance to plant reproduction as the product of visitation rate and single-visit seed set, and regressed pollinator body size on pollen-removal and on seed set effectiveness. Although pollinators differed in effectiveness and visitation rates, pollinator importance was primarily determined by visitation rates. In contrast to similar 2-yr studies, pollinator assemblage composition varied little, suggesting pollinator-mediated selection can be consistent across years for this generalist. Larger pollinators were more effective than smaller at effecting seed set, but body size was a poor predictor of pollen removal ability. Instead, pollen-removal effectiveness may be more influenced by foraging behavior than size.},

It is suggested that these observations are consistent with a simple graphical model relating the standing crop of available nectar to foraging energetics and the additional costs of colonial life (cost of sociality). Temporal variations in foraging behavior were also observed, with Apis again preferring to forage at those times of day (early morning and late afernoon) when resources were most abundant. Bombus was less crepuscular than Apis, and carpenter bees foraged without obvious regard to variation in standing crop. Several factors which may account for this pattern are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Aim: Leafcutter bees use plants as pollen and nectar sources, but also cut leaf discs and use them to line their nests. Which plant species they choose as nesting material and why they do so have remained obscure. We asked the following: (1) How are the plant  species  used  by  leafcutter  bees  distributed  phylogenetically?  (2)  Does  plant  choice differ across geographical regions, and if so, in what ways? (3) Are the leaf plant species natives or exotics? (4) What plant and leaf traits predict selection of plant spe-cies by leafcutter bees? And (5) Does the abundance of individuals per species in the habitat influence leafcutter bees’ plant preferences?
Location: Tropical South Asia, temperate eastern Canada and US Sonoran Desert
Methods: We mapped taxa known to be used by leafcutter bees both from our own study and published literature onto the most recent angiosperm phylogeny. To deter-mine what plant and leaf traits predict leaf selection, we monitored 6,120 individuals of 214 native and exotic plant species planted in a 3- sq. km. arboretum in Arizona and recorded leaf damage inflicted by bees.
Results: Megachile showed a strong preference for species in the rosid clade, particularly the phylogenetic cluster of Fabales, Fagales and Rosales. Thirty- two to forty- five percentage of the leaf plant species were exotic to a given region. Membership in the rosid clade and Fabaceae family predicted plant preference, whereas the plant species’ local abundance and geographical origin did not. Leaf water content, morphotype and the  presence  of  latex  were  important  factors  influencing  plant  choice,  whereas  leaf  shape and size did not.
Main  conclusion:  These  patterns  point  to  plant  groups  whose  availability  should  be  monitored to assure persistence of leafcutter bees. Their preference for specific globally distributed plant clades, yet ability to readily adopt certain exotic plant species as nest resources, likely augments their ability to persist.},

Bumble bees, Bombus impatiens Cresson, were similarly tested in 1 yr; their pollination activities were minimal, and weight of seed produced on female lines in tents containing bumble bees was similar to that in tents without pollinators. Leafcutting bee activity, as measured by the number of female bees at the entrance to tunnels in the hive, at first increased, then decreased with increasing stocking rate. Duration of time spent visiting flowers did not vary with stocking rate, but was longer on male-fertile than on male-sterile flowers. Production of hybrid seed within tents varied with leafcutting bee stocking rate, with the highest seed yield achieved at stocking rates equivalent to three charges at weekly intervals of 400 000 leafcutting bees per hectare. At optimum LCB stocking rates, the method described provided sufficient seed quantity for small-plot multi-location field evaluation of oilseed rape hybrids.},

Molecular dissection of the S-locus revealed that SI represents not one system, but a collection of divergent mechanisms. Here, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of three distinct SI mechanisms, each controlled by two separate determinant genes at the S-locus. In the Brassicaceae, the determinant genes encode a pollen ligand and its stigmatic receptor kinase; their interaction induces incompatible signaling(s) within the stigma papilla cells. In the Solanaceae-type SI, the determinants are a ribonuclease and an F-box protein, suggesting the involvement of RNA and protein degradation in the system. In the Papaveraceae, the only identified female determinant induces a Ca2+-dependent signaling network that ultimately results in the death of incompatible pollen.},

We explored the combined effects of pollination and soil fertility in sunflower using soils from a trial characterized by different long-term input management in order to recreate plausible levels of soil fertility. Pollinator exclusion was used as a proxy for a highly eroded pollination service. Pollination benefits to yield depended on soil fertility, i.e., insect pollination enhanced seed set and yield only under higher soil fertility indicating that limited nutrient availability may constrain pollination benefits. Our study provides evidence for interactions between above- and belowground ecosystem services, highlighting the crucial role of soil fertility in supporting agricultural production not only directly, but also indirectly through pollination. Management strategies aimed at enhancing pollination services might fail in increasing yield in landscapes characterized by high soil service degradation. Comprehensive knowledge about service interactions is therefore essential for the correct management of ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.},

We measured pollination benefits to yield in sunflower, combining a gradient in insect pollination (0, 25, 50, 100\%) with a continuous gradient in nitrogen (N) fertilization (from 0 to 150 kg N ha-1) in an experiment under realistic soil field conditions. We found that pollination benefits to yield were maximized at intermediate levels of N availability, bolstering yield by approximately 25\% compared with complete pollinator exclusion. Interestingly, we found little decrease in yield when insect visits were reduced by 50\%, indicating that the incremental contribution of pollination by insects to yield is greater when the baseline pollination service provision is very low. Our findings provide strong evidence for interactive, nonlinear effects of pollination and resource availability on seed production. Our results support ecological intensification as a promising strategy for sustainable management of agroecosystems. In particular, we found optimal level of pollination to potentially compensate for lower N applications.},

  abstract = {Insect pollination is a well-studied ecosystem service that supports production in 75% of globally important crops. Although yield is known to be sustained and regulated by a bundle of ecosystem services and management factors, the contribution of pollination to yield has been mostly studied in isolation. Here, we compiled and reviewed research on the contribution of pollination to crop yield under different environmental conditions, where the potential interaction between pollination and other factors contributing to yield, such as nutrient availability and control of pests, was tested. Specifically, we explored whether pollination displayed synergistic, compensatory or additive effects with concomitant factors. The literature search resulted in 24 peer-reviewed studies for a total of 39 individual tests of interactions. Studies examined responses in 13 crops testing interactions both at the local and the landscape scale. Interactions between pollination and other factors influencing yield were observed for several crops and mostly displayed positive-synergistic relationships. Crop life-history traits such as pollination dependency were found to affect the plant response to variations in resource and pollen availability. Soil properties and crop pests might affect contribution of pollination to yield by altering the amount of resources a plant can allocate to reproduction, independently of the amount of pollen provided. Current management strategies to enhance pollinators might fail to increase pollination benefits in landscapes characterized by poor soil resources or ineffective pest control. We propose that our understanding of the effects of crop-pollinator interactions will benefit by focusing on plant traits and physiological responses. Combining knowledge from plant physiology and ecology with technological advances in agriculture is needed to design novel management strategies to maximize pollination benefits and support yields and reduce environmental impacts of food production.},

When processed, this oil has been observed to be less stable than oil (typically containing 5 to 25 ppm chlorophyll) processed from high-grade seed. Possible causes for this phenomenon were investigated in this study. The effect of initial pheophytin content was examined by mixing fully saturated oil (tricapryloylglycerol) with increasing amounts of pheophytin and then by subjecting the mixtures to processing conditions. When the processed oils were combined with an unsaturated oil (canola oil), the oxidative stabilities decreased as the pre-processing content of pheophytin increased. Examination of the effect of increased bleaching to remove excessive levels of pheophytin showed that oil stability decreased with increasing exposure to bleaching clay. Additionally, processing treatments did not remove secondary autoxidation products from oil that was abused prior to processing. Such a finding revealed the importance of initial oil quality on processed oil stability, i.e., the greater abuse of the crude oil (resulting in greater contents of secondary oxidation products), the lower the stability of the processed oil. Finally, previous reports by other researchers of pheophytin's pro-oxidative effect in oil stored in light were confirmed.},

(7) Pollen carryover in E. grandiflorum is reduced by bee grooming. 
(8) The negative effect of grooming on carryover is increased when the recipient flowers have undehisced anthers. (9) Erythronium americanum and E. grandiflorum were similar in carryover, but Linaria vulgaris showed much higher carryover. The reasons for this are discussed.},

3 Apis and Bombus removed similar amounts of pollen from apple flowers but Bombus deposited more pollen on stigmas. Pollen-collecting bees removed more pollen from apple anthers than nectar-collecting bees. Apis that approached nectaries laterally deposited substantially less pollen than other visitors. 
4 Apis and Bombus removed and deposited similar amounts of pollen on almond flowers. Apis tended to remove more during pollen-collecting visits than nectar-collecting visits. The type of resource sought did not significantly influence deposition. 
5 Based on removal and deposition data, additions of Bombus may increase pollen delivery in apple orchards but reduce pollen delivery in almond orchards if Apis already serve as primary pollinators. Additional data on inter-tree and inter-row flights would be necessary to know how much these changes in pollen transfer might affect fertilization. 
6 Measures of pollen-transfer effectiveness do not provide a complete assessment of pollination value, but can serve as a general, inexpensive tool for pre-screening possible alternative pollinators.},

Bees foraging in these competitive vacuums probed more flowers per inflorescence than control bees. One bee's foraging was studied intensively before and after its local competitors were removed. Compared to four nestmates foraging elsewhere, the focal bee's trip times were shorter (p<0.005) and its food collection rate was marginally higher (P= 0.064) during the removal, although all the bees foraged similarly before the removal. These observations indicate that traplining bumble bees opportunistically modify their use of space in response to the activities of other bees in a highly competitive environment.},

The model shows that even when there is a resource trade-off between size and number of offspring within individuals, positive correlations between size and number may occur among individuals due to individual variation in resources. Such positive correlations imply that parental resource status affects the fitness-maximizing offspring size, in contrast to the predictions of the standard Smith-Fretwell model. I show that parental resource status affects the fitness-maximizing offspring size whenever the size-number fitness function is nonhomogeneous in offspring number. This condition implies some sort of density-dependent interactions among offspring, although it is possible to have either positive or negative sib interactions in fitness functions that are homogeneous in offspring number. In the latter case offspring size should be insensitive to parental resource status. I explore several cases including linear (Smith-Fretwell), nonlinear but homogeneous, and nonhomogeneous seed-number functions with independent size and number effects, as well as models with interacting offspring size-number effects. I briefly review the plant literature on offspring density dependence and seed-size variation with parental resource status. Some suggestions for testing the ideas with plants and some alternative explanations of positive seed-size/plant-size and seed-size/seed-number correlations are discussed.},

  abstract  = {The number of pods per plant and the number of seeds per pod are the most variable yield components in winter oilseed rape (WOSR). Both the number of ovules per pod and the potential for the ovule to develop into a mature seed may depend on pod position in the plant architecture and time of appearance. The complex developmental pattern of WOSR makes it difficult to analyse. The objectives of this study were to investigate the variability of the following yield components (a) ovules/pod, (b) seeds/pod, and (c) pods/axis in relation to two explanatory variables. These two variables include (1) flower and inflorescence position and (2) time of pod appearance, linked to the effect of assimilate availability. Field experiments were conducted with the variety Mendel. Different trophic states were created by clipping the main stem or ramifications. The number and position of flowers that bloomed within the inflorescence were recorded based on observations every two to three days throughout the flowering season. On the control plants, for the main stem we observed that the number of ovules per pod decreased for a few ranks and then tended to increase and again to decrease at the end. On ramification R1 and R4, the number of ovules increased at first, and then remained constant with the pod rank. Furthermore, the number of ovules per pod remained constant along the inflorescence on the other ramifications and increased with ramifications from top to bottom. The number of seeds per pod did not vary with the pod rank at the basal positions on inflorescences and decreased afterwards along the inflorescence. The clipping of the main stem or ramifications increased the number of ovules per pod, seeds per pod and pods per axis. The number of ovules and seeds per pod did not vary with the time of pod appearance for the pods located at normalised rank 0.01–0.1. However, the number of ovules and seeds per pod can be impacted by the time of pod appearance on the plant scale. Thus, our results indicate that the amount of available assimilates was the primary determinant of pod and seed production during the flowering period. The distribution of resources was significantly affected by both the positions of pods within an inflorescence and the position of inflorescences within a plant.},

Previous investigations predicted maximum foraging distances of 100-200m for small bee species and up to 1100m for very large species based on mainly indirect methods. The present study applied a new and direct approach to experimentally investigate maximum foraging distances in solitary bees. One endangered and two common species of different body sizes, all of which restrict pollen foraging to a single plant genus, were established in a landscape lacking their specific host plants. Females were forced to collect pollen on potted host plants that were successively placed in increasing distance from fixed nesting stands. The maximum foraging distance recorded for the small Hylaeus punctulatissimus was 1100m, for the medium sized Chelostoma rapunculi 1275m and for the large Hoplitis adunca 1400m, indicating that maximum foraging distances at species level have been underestimated. However, the capability to use resources on such a large spatial scale applied only to a small percentage of individuals as 50% of the females of H. punctulatissimus and H. adunca did not forage at distances longer than 100-225m and 300m, respectively. This finding suggests that a close neighbourhood of nesting and foraging habitat within few hundred meters is crucial to maintain populations of these species, and that threshold distances at which half of the population discontinues foraging are a more meaningful parameter for conservation practice than the species specific maximum foraging distances.},

We investigate optimal farm design for agricultural pollination services from bees nesting in native habitat, integrating ecological and economic approaches in a spatial modeling framework. We evaluate the simplest case, and then add consideration of bee metapopulation dynamics and heterogeneity in farmland productivity. We find that the need for spatially even pollination coverage across farms means that bee habitat is often denser at the edges, rather than the centers, of optimally designed farms, and also highly constrains the ability of farmers to site bee habitat in less-productive areas of farms with spatial gradients in agricultural fertility. Optimal farm configuration is not purely a matter of uniform size and spacing of bee habitat: in some circumstances, farms combine large parcels—to ensure bee population persistence—with smaller, dispersed patches to provide spatially continuous pollination services. The highest-yield farm designs are those with a relatively small (but non-zero) area of pollination reservoirs, suggesting a conservation strategy of small parcels of service-providing habitat interspersed throughout working landscapes. The design principles outlined here are likely general and applicable to other ecosystem services supplied at local scales, such as agricultural pest control.},

  abstract  = {Theory predicts that the susceptibility of patches of plants to gene flow mediated by incoming pollinators will depend on the length of pollinator residence (the number of flowers visited during a bout in a patch). We sought to determine whether pollinator residence is sufficiently sensitive to patch size and separation to influence levels of gene flow significantly. We studied oilseed rape Brassica napus as an exemplar of a conventional animal-pollinated plant and as a species where there is a risk of genetic escape from genetically modified (GM) varieties. 
We determined pollinator residence in 36 patches created by mowing an agricultural field of flowering oilseed rape. Each square patch had an edge length of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 m. Patches were separated by either 9 m or 18 m from the border of a large unmown area of crop. We used the residence of bumblebees (Bombus s) to solve a model of bumblebee-mediated gene flow. 
Bumblebee residence increased significantly with patch area, but did not depend on the separation distance of the patch from the large areas of crop. Even in the largest patches, bees visited only c. 60 of the c. 1 × 105 flowers before leaving. 
If bumblebees were the sole pollinators, the model predicted that 4-8% of the seed produced by the smaller patches (c. 80-320 plants) had fathers outside the patch, whereas in the larger patches (720-8000 plants) the prediction was 2-4%. Nevertheless, larger patches should produce the greatest number of seeds with extrinsic paternity. 
Synthesis and applications. Our observations demonstrate that susceptibility to pollinator-mediated gene flow is liable to decrease systematically as the size of plant patches increases. These findings can inform the management of genetic diversity in and among small or fragmented populations. If the patch size-gene flow relationship that we observed applies to larger scales, the model could estimate gene flow between GM crops and volunteer or feral populations in agricultural landscapes.},

  abstract  = {Bumblebees of any one species in Maine forage for pollen and/or nectar from a large variety of morphologically diverse flowers, but individuals have limited foraging repertoires at any one time. Unspecialized individuals were sometimes unsuccessful in extracting nectar and/or pollen from highly rewarding flowers. In any one area with a variety of concurrently blooming plants, the bumblebees had apparent species preferences. Superimposed on the species preferences were individual preferences. Individuals had primary foraging specialties (their majors) and secondary specialities (their minors). Minors were often bridges to new majors. Queens in Maine necessarily have several successive majors during their lifetime since the blooming time of the plants they utilize are brief relative to their life-span as foragers. However, the blooming time of most plants available to Bombus fervidus workers are long relative to their lifetime. Switching was rarely observed in these bees, even in some individuals observed daily for up to 1 mo at the same foraging area containing other plant species in bloom that were highly attractive to other individuals of the same bumblebee species. On a per flower basis, those flowers producing the most food rewards generally had the largest number of bees majoring from them, and the food rewards available were roughly comparable between different kinds of flowers, regardless of their differences in rates of nectar production. Specializing was usually preceded by sampling a variety of rewarding as well as nonrewarding flowers. When the flowers from which bees were majoring in an area were experimentally removed many of the bees sampled flowers of other concurrently blooming plants, but they generally did not switch to flowers from which the food rewards were being depleted by specialists, unless these were experimentally fortified with syrup. Upon finding superior food rewards in enriched blossoms, they switched immediately. Flower-specificity is related to site-specificity. Many bees shared the same foraging area, but different individual bees at the same site utilized the flowers of different plant species. When the foraging area contained landmarks, the bees visited clumps of flowers in a sequence (foraging path) that was generally repeated several times on the same foraging trip when the foraging site was small. The foraging behavior of bumblebees is discussed from a comparative standpoint with other bees and in relation to food distribution and availability in the environment.},

  abstract  = {Production of hybrid seed canola requires the transfer of pollen from hermaphroditic (‘male’) to male-sterile (‘female’) plants, facilitated by managed pollinators (honey and leafcutter bees) and wild pollinators. I assessed pollinators in fields of hybrid seed canola located in Southern Alberta to determine what behaviours and conditions could enhance pollen transfer between male and female plants. I found that managed species were the most common pollinators, that all pollinators exhibited floral constancy to morph (male or female), and that pollinator type, time on flower, pollen on body, and flower of origin influenced pollination effectiveness. Pollinator movement between male and female flowers was positively affected by densities of conspecific pollinators, taxon richness, and relative floral profit. While hybrid seed canola morphs are sexually dimorphic, sufficient quantities of managed pollinators should reduce floral constancy. Wild pollinators can contribute to cross-pollination indirectly by increasing managed pollinator movement via increased diversity.},

The grasslands greatly differed in the number of honey bee colonies within a radius of 2 km and were surrounded by agricultural habitats. The number of flower-visiting honey bees on both potted mustard plants and small grassland patches declined with increasing distance from the nearest apiary and was almost zero at a distance of 1.5--2.0 km. Wild bees were observed visiting 57 plant species, whereas honey bees visited only 24 plant species. Percentage resource overlap between honey bees and wild bees was 45.5{\%}, and Hurlbert's index of niche overlap was 3.1. In total, 1849 wild bees from 98 species were recorded on the calcareous grasslands. Neither species richness nor abundance of wild bees were negatively correlated with the density of honey bee colonies (within a radius of 2 km) or the density of flower-visiting honey bees per site. Abundance of flower- visiting wild bees was correlated only with the percentage cover of flowering plants. In 240 trap nests, 1292 bee nests with 6066 brood cells were found. Neither the number of bee species nor the number of brood cells per grassland was significantly correlated with the density of honey bees. Significant correlations were found only between the number of brood cells and the percentage cover of shrubs. The number of nest entrances of ground-nesting bees per square metre was not correlated with the density of honey bees but was negatively correlated with the cover of vegetation. Interspecific competition by honey bees for food resources was not shown to be a significant factor determining abundance and species richness of wild bees.},

For every cohort of flowers an array of yield measures was calculated, including the mean and total cohort dry weight of fruits, and the numbers of viable and aborted seeds and completely undeveloped ovules. When mature, pods were removed from half of the plants. Plants whose mature pods were removed produced significantly greater numbers of flowers, ovules and viable seeds and a greater total weight of pods than did untreated plants. However, the proportion of ovules giving rise to viable seeds and to aborted seeds and undeveloped ovules was the same in plants of both groups. Approximately 50% of ovules of marketable pods, in all plants, yielded viable seeds. The 12 cohorts of flowers contributed markedly different amounts to plant yield. Early and later cohorts contributed much less than did middle cohorts in terms of marketable pod dry weight and numbers of fully developed seeds, aborted seeds, and undeveloped ovules. Peak productivity was therefore obtained from the middle phase of flowering in these annual bean plants. The lower pod yield of later cohorts is interpreted as a result of competition for limited resources between maturing pods and new flowers. We consider possible causes for the various fates of flowers and ovules and discuss flowers as plant modules suitable for demographic examination.},

Pollinator treatments comprised of high pollinator density (a small honeybee colony and 10 mason bees, Osmia rufa), and a gradient of increasing O. rufa densities from zero (control) up to 100 bees per cage. High pollinator densities increased the seed weight per plant from 6.5 g to 56.9 g for the MS line. However seed weight did not differ between high pollinator densities and controls for the MF line. Increasing densities of O. rufa had a significant effect on almost all yield components of the MS line, but only marginal effects on the MF line. The number of seeds per pod, the seed weight per plant and the harvest index (seed weight/plant dry weight) of the MS line showed a significantly steeper increase with increasing bee density than that of the MF line. The results suggest that solitary bees could be used successfully to replace honeybees as pollinators of MS oilseed rape in isolation cages.},

  title     = {The provision of pollination services to agroecosystems by a diverse assemblage of wild, unmanaged insect taxa},
  school    = {James Cook University},
  year      = {2010},
  abstract  = {The current global pollination crisis highlights the advantages of the provision of pollination services by a suite of core pollinators. Recent declines in honeybee populations have focused attetion on the potential for unmanaged insects to replace them as pollinators of global food crops. The ability of unmanaged pollinators to replace services currently provided by honeybees requires understanding of their efficiency as pollinators as well as the spatial and temporal variability of their services, yet few quantitative assessments currently exist. In order to understand if unmanaged pollinator taxa are capable of providing equivalent polination services to the honeybee I compared the pollination services provided by unmanaged taxa to the honeybee within a Brassica rapa mass flowering crop in a highly modified New Zealand agricultural landscape. First, I examined four functional traits of insect flower visitors in order to compare the pollination services provided: per visit pollen deposition, the probability of stigmatic contact, visitation rate, and capacity to transport pollen over distance. Second, I investigated how these traits vary between unmanaged pollinators and the honeybee both in space (between field locations) and time (within a day and between years) to examine whether unmanaged pollinators are capable of providing consistent, stable pollination services to a B. rapa mass flowering agricultural crop.

I observed a total of 41 managed and unmanaged taxa visiting flowers of B. rapa. In addition to A. mellifera, seven insects species visited flowers frequently. These were three other bees: Lasioglossum sordidum, Bombus terrestris and Leioproctus sp.; and four flies: Dilophus nigrostima, Melanostoma fasciatum, Melangyna novaezelandiae and Eristalis tenax. Two bee species, Bombus terrestris and Leioproctus sp. and one fly, Eristalis tenax were as efficient as the honeybee and as effective (in terms of rate of flower visitation). A higher honeybee abundance however, resulted in it being the more effective pollinator overall. All frequently visiting pollinators were consistent in their visits over a four year period, even though individually visit frequencies varied between taxa. The pooled services of the unmanaged taxa were equal to or better than the honeybee in three of the four years.

Pollinators were active at different times of the day. Most unmanaged fly taxa were most active early in the morning and late in the afternoon/evening. Managed and unmanaged bee taxa and one fly (D. nigrostigma) were more active in the middle of the day. Overall visitation rate did not differ significantly between the hours within a day, indicating that changing taxonomic composition in assemblage structure was not accompanied by changes in potential pollination services. The contributions to visitation rate provided by fly taxa outside of standard survey hours resulted in a higher visitation rate at the end of the day.

Both managed and unmanaged pollinators transported viable pollen outside of a B. rapa crop. These consisted of three species from two bee families (Hymenoptera: Apidae and Halictidae), and seven species from four fly families (Diptera: Bibiondae, Stratiomyidae, Syrphidae and Tachinidae). Pollen viability varied between insect families and declined with distance from the crop but was nonetheless carried to at least 300m outside of the crop.

The results of this study suggest alternative pollinator taxa are capable of performing pollination services in mass flower crop equal to or better than the managed European honeybee. Alternative land management practices that increase the population sizes of unmanaged pollinator taxa to levels resulting in visitation frequencies as high as A. mellifera, have the potential to replace services provided by the honeybee. At the time of this study the Varroa sp. mite had not been recorded in the Canterbury region of New Zealand, where this study was conducted. It has since been recorded in this area, representing a significant possible threat to pollination services and hence crop production. My results have direct application suggesting that pollination services historically provided by managed honeybees might be replaced by those provided by other existing unmanaged pollinator taxa. Evidence from my study suggests that increases in the abundances of these alternative taxa should translate into greater pollination services.

To increase the population sizes of unmanaged pollinator taxa, I suggests ``in-situ" management. This will require a change in land management practices in order to ensure year round refuge, feeding, nesting, and other resource requirements of pollinator taxa are met.},

This behaviour does not maximise the net rate of energy extraction from the food sources, and thus contradicts predictions of some common models for central place foragers. We show that including the metabolic costs of transport of nectar leads to models that predict partial crop-loading. Furthermore, the observed crop loads of honeybees are less consistent with those predicted by maximization of delivery rate to the hive (net energetic gain/ unit time), than with those predicted by maximization of energetic efficiency (net energetic gain/unit energy expenditure). We argue that maximization of energetic efficiency may be an adaptation to a limited flight-cost budget. This constraint is to be expected because a worker's condition seems to deteriorate as a function of the amount of flight performed.},

The most common ALCB management practice is the loose cell system, in which cocooned bees are removed from nesting cavities for cleaning and storage. Traits of ALCBs that favored their commercialization include gregarious nesting; use of leaves for lining nests; ready acceptance of affordable, mass-produced nesting materials; alfalfa pollination efficacy; and emergence synchrony with alfalfa bloom. The ALCB became a commercial success because much of its natural history was understood, targeted research was pursued, and producer ingenuity was encouraged. The ALCB presents a model system for commercializing other solitary bees and for advancing new testable hypotheses in diverse biological disciplines.},

A low percentage of bees (46–79% of released) survived the incubation and field-emergence processes; of those bees, the number of females that established at the nesting sites was 25–100%. Of the three field sites, one site consistently retained more females and produced more completed nests than the other sites, all of which usually had poor female establishment and progeny production. In addition, floral resources were depleted over time, but many flowers remained unvisited over the season. Nest production decreased over time, as numbers of flowers and female bees declined. Significant positive relationships were found between the intended stocking densities and 1) the number of females that actually survived incubation and field emergence and 2) the number of females that established nests. The number of females that established nests was positively affected by the number of females that survived to emerge in the field. The percentage of females that established was not significantly affected by the intended number of released bees, countering a prediction that the release of fewer bees would allow more females to establish nests and achieve high reproductive success. For growers, it may be more frugal to use modest numbers of M. rotundata for pollination, because many of the bees at medium and high stocking densities do not nest in grower-provided bee boards.},

Pollination by wind is feasible, however, and its likely effectiveness is not immediately foreseeable because of the complexity of interactions between objects and windborne particles. 
2 Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind-tunnel experiments were used to investigate the aerodynamic interactions between the flower and a windborne suspension of its pollen. 
3 The flower's petals handicapped wind pollination by reducing the target efficiency of the upwind-facing stigma. For downwind-facing flowers, pollen reception was negligible.
4 Several aspects of the plant's architecture (floral structure, pollen cohesiveness, inflorescence structure) are uncompromisingly zoophilous. Estimates of the amount of wind pollination suggest that it is unlikely to be important for the long-distance dispersal of B. napus genes such as those from genetically modified varieties.

A 10:1 ratio of male sterile line (A-line) to pollen parent was employed. Leaf cutter bees (Megachile rotundata F.) were used as the pollen vector between the two parents.

Differences in hybrid seed yields among A-line rows were significant for all locations and years. Leaf cutter bees were found to be effective pollinators of the A-line plants. Less than half and less than a third of the seed produced on the A-line rows in 1986 and 1987, respectively, was hybrid seed. The high percentage of non-hybrid seed present in the seed lot may have been due to incomplete male sterility of the Marnoo A-line population. Total seed yields, hybrid seed yields and percent hybridity all declined linearly as distance from the pollen source increased. Improvement in the degree of male sterility of the Marnoo A-line population and/or a reduction in the 10:1 ratio of parents, and subsequent maximum A-line row to R-line row distance, will be necessary if hybrid summer rape seed production using this pol CMS A-line is to be commercially viable},

  abstract  = {Insect pollination of flowers should change the within-season allocation of resources in plants. But the nature of this life-history response, particularly regarding allocation to roots, photosynthetic structures, and flowers, is empirically unresolved. This study uses a greenhouse experiment to investigate the effect of insect pollination on the reproductive output of 23 varieties of a globally important crop—canola (Brassica napus). Overall, insect pollination modified the functional characteristics (flower timing & effort, plant size & shape, seed packaging, root biomass) of canola, increasing seed production and quality, and pollinator dependence. Reproductive output and pollinator dependence were defined by strong trait trade-offs, which ranged from more pollinator-dependent plants favouring early reproductive effort, to less pollinator-dependent plants favouring a prolonged phenology with smaller plant size and lower seed quality. Seed production decreased with pollinator dependence in the absence of pollinators. The agricultural preference for hybrid varieties will increase seed production compared to open-pollinated varieties, but, even so, pollinators typically enhance seed production of both types. Our study elucidates how insect pollination alters the character and function of a globally important crop, supporting optimization of yield via intensification of insect pollination, and highlights the beneficial effects of insect pollination early in the season.},

For exposure-disease associations, an indirect form of Berkson’s fallacy in which the exposure is associated with a different disease leading to the hospitalization of the case (or control) can produce situations equivalent to Berkson’s fallacy. This indirect Berkson’s fallacy will tend to be of smaller magnitude than the direct fallacy. The fallacy is largely attenuated by limiting enrollment to incident cases (and controls when hospital-based controls are used) and is completely prevented by excluding cases (and controls) with a different disease as the reason for their hospitalization. The nature of the bias proposed by Berkson has led to repeated similar debates over a period of more than 60 years, among other reasons because of confusion with other types of selection biases.

The classical Berkson fallacy, formulated as prevalent disease-disease associations, may only rarely have been a problem in epidemiological studies directed at causes of diseases because diseases are rarely studied as causes of other diseases. The indirect form of Berksons fallacy may only have been a problem in hospital-based case-control studies with prevalent cases wherein the disease for which a person was enrolled in the case-control study was not the reason for that person’s hospitalization. Studies with prevalent cases, however, within or outside hospital, are in general a minority of case-control studies.31 The most common design choices in hospital-based case-control studies seem to preclude a large role of Berkson bias in epidemiology.},

  abstract  = {- Shade stress was used to identify the critical period for yield formation in canola.
- The critical period had a duration of 400 °Cd, centered 300 °Cd after flowering commenced
- Seed oil content had the same critical period as that for yield.
- The crop has the greatest number of sensitive buds and flowers during the critical period.
- The critical period is a useful target for further genetic and agronomic research.

Despite its global significance as an edible oil and biofuel, the critical period for yield determination in canola (edible oilseed rape – Brassica napus L.) has not been determined in the field. Field experiments were conducted at two contrasting sites in southern Australia where 100 °Cd shading periods (15% PAR transmitted) were applied from early vegetative growth until maturity to identify the developmental period when the crop was most sensitive to stress. Despite the significant difference between the two sites for yield in the unshaded control (450 g m−2 in New South Wales, and 340 g m−2 in South Australia), the critical period was consistent at both sites extending from 100 to 500 °Cd after the start of flowering (BBCH60), and centred 300 °Cd after BBCH60. Seed number (seed m−2) was reduced by an average of 48% in the critical period, generated in equal parts by reduced pod m−2 in the early part of the period, and reduced seed pod−1 in the latter part. Reduced seed number was partially compensated by an increase in seed size of 29%. These trends were similar on the branches and main stem. On the main stem, the timing of the critical period moved from earlier to later from lower to upper pods linked to the timing of their development. Seed oil content declined and protein content increased under shading in the critical period, while both oil and protein yield (kg m−2) were reduced by 40–50% and 30–40% respectively. The critical period is coincident with the greatest number of near-open buds and newly opened flowers, which are highly sensitive to assimilate supply for ovule development. Both pod abortion and restricted capacity for compensatory growth of surviving pods are consequences of assimilate restriction on developing ovules. Identification of the critical period provides a useful target for breeding and management strategies to maximize productivity.},

Approximately one-third of the ovules did not contain an embryo sac and sterility, due to the absence of embryo sac, accounted for most of the difference between the numbers of ovules and seeds. Within the terminal raceme, both a decreased proportion of fertile ovules and a lower number of ovules per ovary in apical flowers contributed to the lower number of seeds per pod in the mature apical pods compared to the basal ones. A study of ovule development before flower opening showed that differences in the differentiation of the embryo sacs arose before the buds were 40 mm long and probably involved the stages of meiosis II and/or differentiation of the chalazal megaspore.},

  abstract  = {- Canola yield is limited by source availability during seed filling while it can be limited by sink size established during flowering.
- Agronomy management and breeding activities need to be directed toward increasing assimilate supply.

In canola, strong competition for assimilates from the overlapping of structural and reproductive growth can lead canola yield to be limited by source availability during seed filling. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by manipulating source-sink relationships in a series of experiments (i) shading during flowering and during seed filling, (ii) partial removal of flowers and pods of individual plants, (iii) defoliation at the vegetative stage and after full flowering, and (iv) supplemental irrigation during seed filling. Shading (60% of incoming radiation reduction) during flowering reduced the number of pods and seeds (sink) but increased mean seed weight (MSW), resulting in 24% yield loss. Shading during seed-filling reduced MSW as well as the number of pods and seeds per area and, causing 26% yield reduction compared to the control. Partial pod removal and full defoliation at full flowering decreased pods per plant and reduced yield by10–40%. Defoliation during the vegetative stage reduced yield by 11%. Supplemental irrigation increased yield by 10% without any impact on MSW. However, these manipulations simultaneously either reduced or increased the sink size (seeds m−2) while altering the source availability. If the manipulated plants were assumed to have a similar sink size to the control, shading would have decreased MSW by 16–22%. Similarly, the full defoliation after full flowering decreased MSW by 27% and the defoliation at the vegetative stage by 11%. On the contrary, supplemental irrigation would have increased MSW by 8–21%. The decrease in MSW in the downward-manipulation of source availability and the increase in MSW in the upward-manipulation of source availability indicate that canola yield was driven by source availability during seed filling period. However, yield reduction from shading at flowering indicates that yield could be limited by sink size established during flowering. Therefore, agronomic management and future breeding should be directed to increase assimilates available to the crop from flowering onwards.},

The influence of various parameters was studied. Regarding the effect of time of collection (fig 1, table I): the nectar secretions at 8 am were more abundant (mean of 60%) and less concentrated (= 1/3) than those at 2 pm; the relative concentrations of each sugar (glucose, fructose) were similar at 8 am and 2 pm and close to 50%. Compared to Darmor, cybrids produced less nectar (50% less for 27, 58, 85 and 90% less for 77 and 118). Regarding the effect of the day of collection (fig 2, table II): on average, the secretions were more abundant on May 3rd than on April 15th (23% more). Independently of the day, Darmor secreted more than the cybrids (65-95% more). The dry matter (19.3-22.4 mg/100 &mu;l) and the mean concentrations of each sugar (= 50%) were similar every day. Regarding the combined effect of the day and location (fig 3, tables III, IV): for every day and location, secretions were similar within cybrids and lower than that in Darmor (54-58% less). Amounts secreted (2-4 &mu;l on average) and total sugar amounts (= 15-40 mg/100 &mu;l) differed according to day and location, whereas the relative concentrations of each sugar remained constant. Thus, although large fluctuations might occur in the amounts of nectar, the glucidic composition of the nectars appeared to remain constant in each cybrid and favorable for entomophilous pollination.},

  abstract  = {The ideal-free distribution and central-place foraging are important ecological models that can explain the distribution of foraging organisms in their environment. However, this model ignores distance-based foraging costs from a central place (hive, nest), whereas central-place foraging ignores competition. Different foraging currencies and cooperation between foragers also create different optimal distributions of foragers, but are limited to a simple two-patch model. We present a hybrid model of the ideal-free distribution that uses realistic competitive effects although accounting for distance-based foraging, and test it using honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) foraging in canola fields (Brassica napus L.). Our simulations show that foragers maximizing efficiency (energy profits $\div$ losses) prioritize distance to their aggregation more than those maximizing net-rate (energy profits $\div$ time), and that social foragers move to more distant patches to maximize group benefits, meaning that social foragers do not approach an ideal-free distribution. Simulated efficiency-maximizers had a hump-shaped relationship of trip times with distance, spending shorter amounts of time in both nearby and far-away patches. Canola fields were far more attractive to simulated foragers than semi-natural areas, suggesting limited foraging on semi-natural lands during the bloom period of canola. Finally, we found that the observed distribution of honey bees in canola fields most closely resembled the optimal distribution of solitary efficiency-maximizers. Our model has both theoretical and practical uses, as it allows us to model central-place forager distributions in complex landscapes as well as providing information on appropriate hive stocking rates for agricultural pollination.},

  abstract  = {Pollinator availability and effectiveness are important considerations in plant systems that depend on insect transfer of pollen. In mixed-flower systems (such as dioecious or gynodioecious systems), pollinators may distinguish between morphs, a behaviour which could have negative implications if it leads to reduced cross-pollination. We examined pollinator visitation, response, and effectiveness in hybrid canola seed production, a gynodioecious crop, to understand how pollinator behaviour contributes to cross-pollination between ‘male’ (hermaphroditic) and ‘female’ (male-sterile) morphs. The pollinator types found in these fields differ in visitation rate, size, and pollen load, factors that may affect pollen transfer between plants. The willingness of pollinators to move between male and female flowers can also affect pollen deposition. We used an interview bouquet to present unvisited female inflorescences to different pollinator types visiting male and female flowers to understand behavioural responses to floral morphs and the factors that contribute to better pollination effectiveness. Managed pollinators (honey and leafcutter bees) were far more abundant than wild pollinators in this system. Bees foraging on male flowers were less likely to accept a proffered female flower than those foraging on female flowers. Pollen deposition on stigmas was influenced by pollinator type (female leafcutter bees were the most effective) and increased with time spent on a flower. Pollinators transferring from a male flower to a female flower deposited more pollen than those that originated on female flowers, emphasizing the importance of transfer between male and female morphs. Surprisingly, pollinators carrying more pollen transferred less pollen to recipient stigmas.},

Here we introduce the R package ‘dagitty’, which provides access to all of the capabilities of the DAGitty web application within the R platform for statistical computing, and also offers several new functions. We describe how the R package ‘dagitty’ can be used to: evaluate whether a DAG is consistent with the dataset it is intended to represent; enumerate ‘statistically equivalent’ but causally different DAGs; and identify exposure-outcome adjustment sets that are valid for causally different but statistically equivalent DAGs. This functionality enables epidemiologists to detect causal misspecifications in DAGs and make robust inferences that remain valid for a range of different DAGs.
