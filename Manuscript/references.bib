It has been hypothesized that the aphid is present on those areas with a thin winter snow cover and which therefore clear of snow earlier in the season. This early snow clearance results in a longer growing period and allows the aphid to experience at least the minimum number of degree days required to complete its life cycle. However, this hypothesis lacked a detailed field validation. We aimed to test the relationship between the aphid distribution and time of snow clearance at landscape scale, mapping snow depth at peak of snow accumulation for the two succeeding years 2009 and 2010 and examining site occupancy and plant phenology the following summers. Additionally, the distribution range mapped by Strathdee & Bale (1995) was revisited to address possible changes in range along the coast of the fjord.},

  abstract  = {In intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, many species are confined to very small uncultivated areas such as field margins. However, it has been suggested that these small habitat elements cannot support viable populations of all the species observed there. Instead, species richness and abundance in these small habitat fragments may, at least partly, be dependent on dispersal from larger semi-natural grassland fragments.
We tested this hypothesis for butterflies and bumble bees in 12 independent landscapes in a region of intense agriculture in southern Sweden. In each landscape we surveyed abundance and species richness in one semi-natural grassland, one linear habitat (uncultivated field margin) adjacent to this (called proximate) and one similar linear habitat (called distant) situated at least 1000 m from the semi-natural grassland patch.
Both species richness and density (individuals per unit area) of butterflies and bumble bees were significantly higher in proximate linear habitats than in distant ones. Moreover, butterfly species richness was higher for a given area in grasslands than in any of the linear habitat types. Butterfly density in grasslands did not differ from that in proximate linear habitats but was lower in distant linear habitats. The effect of isolation on density was stronger for less mobile butterfly species. For bumble bees there was no difference in species richness between grasslands and proximate linear habitats.
For at least some of the butterfly species even these relatively small fragments of semi-natural grasslands act as population sources from which individuals disperse to the surrounding habitats and thereby contribute to higher densities and species richness in adjacent areas. For bumble bees, it is more likely that the grasslands contain a higher density of nests than the surrounding intensively cultivated landscape, and that the density of foraging bumble bees decreases with increasing distance from the nest.
Synthesis and application. Habitat fragmentation and intensified agricultural practices are considered to be a threat against services provided by pollinators. In order to sustain the abundance and diversity of insect pollinators in intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, we suggest that preservation of the remaining semi-natural grasslands or re-creation of flower-rich grasslands is essential.},

A model is developed to examine how animals with limited abilities to perceive differences in patch quality affect an IFD by foragers. This constraint produces the observed bias, a bias that is exaggerated as the number of patches increases. Sutherland (1983) has developed a model based on interference which can also explain the observed bias. The two models can be differentiated in that only the perception limit model (this paper) is sensitive to absolute changes in overall resource availability and to increases in the number of animals. Additionally, Sutherland's model predicts that when deviations away from an IFD occur there will be no differences in intake rates, while the perception limit model predicts that intake rates should vary between patches.},

The analysis concentrates on foraging behavior and asks (1) whether the cost factor that has the greatest effect on fitness generally has the greatest effect on optimal trait values and (2) whether increasing the size of one type of cost makes the optimal behavior absolutely or relatively more sensitive to that cost. The foraging costs considered are energy expenditure, predation risk, and other mortality factors. It is shown that increasing the magnitude of one cost often decreases the relative and absolute sensitivity of the optimal foraging strategy to that cost. The relative fitness effects of different costs generally differ from the relative sensitivities of the optimal strategies to the cost factors. Researchers should therefore measure the shapes of cost curves rather than their average magnitudes to determine which of several costs can be ignored in cost-benefit analyses.},

The behavioral dynamics of habitat choice used in a range of previous models are reviewed. There is very limited empirical evidence for distinguishing between these different models, but they differ in important ways, and many lack properties that would guar- antee stability of an ideal free distribution in a single-species system. The importance of finding out more about movement dynamics in multispecies systems is shown by an analysis of the effect of move- ment rules on the dynamics of a particular two-species - two-patch model of competition, where the population dynamical equilibrium in the absence of movement is often not a behavioral equilibrium in the presence of adaptive movement. The population dynamics of this system are explored for several different movement rules and different parameter values, producing a variety of outcomes. Other systems of interacting species that may lack a dynamically stable distribution among patches are discussed, and it is argued that such systems are not rare. The sensitivity of community properties to individual movement behavior in this and earlier studies argues that there is a great need for empirical investigation to determine the applicability of different models of the behavioral dynamics of habitat selection.},

Since most of the oilseed crops are crosspollinated, adequate pollination is vital for any significant seed production. Among the various pollinating agents, honeybees play a predominant role in increasing the yield of rapeseed. Almost one-third of total cropped area under oilseeds has been reported to be entomophilous. The yield of rapeseed and mustard can be doubled through pollination by insects. Pollinators not only enhance the yield of the crop but also contribute to uniform and early pod setting. Therefore, planned honeybee pollination could result in increased productivity and improvement in other parameters through the process of heterosis. Both protective applications of pesticides against pests and use of bees should be integrated in a manner to boost oilseed production and honey production. The relevant information on the mutualistic interactions between honeybees and rapeseed is discussed in this chapter to stimulate further research eV orts to enhance productivity of oilseed crops.},

Trunk trails of harvester ants have been considered as devices that avoid competition between neighboring colonies, which give rise to irregular foraging territories around the nests. This hypothesis is valid for strict central-place foragers but loses strength when the colonies have several nest entrances and approach a dispersed central-place strategy. The strategies of trunk trail allocation in a harvester ant species (Messor barbarus) with both trunk trails and multiple nest entrances are studied in order to ascertain the outcome of the oppositing forces of neighborhood competition and trail arrangement within the colonies. Evidence is found of inter- and intracolonial competitive interactions in the arrangement of trunk trails in this species. Intracolonial competition seems to be superimposed on intercolonial interactions, which generates a composite pattern of trail allocation in which dispersed and central-place foraging concur.},

We generalize the concept of ecological neighborhoods to represent regions of activity or influence during periods of time appropriate to particular ecological processes. Therefore, there is no single ecological neighborhood for any given organism, but rather a number of neighborhoods, each appropriate to different processes. Neighborhood sizes can be estimated by examining the cumulative distribution of activity or influence of an organism as a function of increasingly large spatial units. The spatial and temporal dimensions of neighborhoods provide the scales necessary for assessing environmental patterning relative to particular ecological processes for a given species. Consistent application of the neighborhood concept will assist in the choice of appropriate study units, comparisons among different studies, and comparisons between empirical studies and theoretical postulates.},

  abstract  = {For more than 30 years, the relationship between net primary productivity and species richness has generated intense debate in ecology about the processes regulating local diversity. The original view, which is still widely accepted, holds that the relationship is hump-shaped, with richness first rising and then declining with increasing productivity. Although recent meta-analyses questioned the generality of hump-shaped patterns, these syntheses have been criticized for failing to account for methodological differences among studies. We addressed such concerns by conducting standardized sampling in 48 herbaceous-dominated plant communities on five continents. We found no clear relationship between productivity and fine-scale (meters^-2) richness within sites, within regions, or across the globe. Ecologists should focus on fresh, mechanistic approaches to understanding the multivariate links between productivity and richness.},

Statistical results revealed that the factors: salinity, cultivar, and their interaction had significant (P<0.01) effect on germination rate and 8 leaf seedling dry matter. Based on statistical analysis seed yield was significantly influenced by both salinity and cultivar at the 5% significance level; while the cultivar factor had a significant effect on seed oil content, salinity did not show any effect on seed oil content. Analytical results, using the wellknown sigmoid or S-shape salinity response function gave reliable results for determining tolerant and sensitive cultivars to salinity. Applying an existing model on canola response to salinity levels in different growth stages, the values of C50 and P parameters were developed for local canola cultivars. Results showed that the response of cultivars to salinity levels vary in different growth stages. While a cultivar is tolerant in a growth stage, it may be sensitive to salinity in another growth stage. Based on observed data and ANOVA analysis, we concluded that ACSN1, Shiraly, and Falcon can be ranked as salt-tolerant, and Global and Oyerka as the salt-sensitive cultivars.},

Field margins can serve as nesting and foraging habitats for wild bees and can be a source of pollinators. Regional differences in pollinator community composition may affect this spill-over of bees. We studied how regional and local differences affect the spatial distribution of wild bee species richness, activity-density and body size in crop fields. We sampled bees both from the field centre and at two different types of semi-natural field margins, grass strips and hedges, in 12 strawberry fields. The fields were distributed over four regions in Northern Europe, representing an almost 1100 km long north-south gradient. Even over this gradient, daytime temperatures during sampling did not differ significantly between regions and did therefore probably not impact bee activity. Bee species richness was higher in field margins compared with field centres independent of field size. However, there was no difference between centre and margin in body-size or activity-density. In contrast, bee activity-density increased towards the southern regions, whereas the mean body size increased towards the north. In conclusion, our study revealed a general pattern across European regions of bee diversity, but not activity-density, declining towards the field interior which suggests that the benefits of functional diversity of pollinators may be difficult to achieve through spill-over effects from margins to crop. We also identified dissimilar regional patterns in bee diversity and activity-density, which should be taken into account in conservation management.},

  abstract  = {The prospect that a global pollination crisis currently threatens agricultural productivity has drawn intense recent interest among scientists, politicians, and the general public. To date, evidence for a global crisis has been drawn from regional or local declines in pollinators themselves or insufficient pollination for particular crops. In contrast, our analysis of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data reveals that the global population of managed honey-bee hives has increased ~45% during the last half century and suggests that economic globalization, rather than biological factors, drives both the dynamics of the global managed honey-bee population and increasing demands for agricultural pollination services. Nevertheless, available data also reveal a much more rapid (>300%) increase in the fraction of agriculture that depends on animal pollination during the last half century, which may be stressing global pollination capacity. Although the primary cause of the accelerating increase of the pollinator dependence of commercial agriculture seems to be economic and political and not biological, the rapid expansion of cultivation of many pollinator-dependent crops has the potential to trigger future pollination problems for both these crops and native species in neighboring areas. Such environmental costs merit consideration during the development of agriculture and conservation policies.},

Noticeably rare, however, are attempts to quantify temporal variation in the structure of plant–pollinator networks, and to determine whether the status of species as specialists or generalists is stable. Here we show that network structure varied through time in a montane meadow community from southern California, USA, in that pollinator species did not form the same links with plant species across years. Furthermore, composition of the generalized core group of species in the network varied among summers, as did the identity of those species involved in relationships that appeared to be reciprocally specialized within any one summer. These differences appear to be related to severe drought conditions experienced in the second summer of the 3 year study. In contrast to this variation, the pollinator community remained similarly highly nested in all three summers, even though species were packed into the nested matrix differently from year to year. These results suggest that plant–pollinator networks vary in detail through time, while retaining some basic topological properties. This dynamic aspect of community-scale interactions has implications for both ecological and evolutionary inferences about pollination mutualisms.},

The experiment was run at one subarctic site and one alpine site for 2 years and 1 year, respectively, using open‐top chambers (OTC).

The 2‐year temperature enhancement at the subarctic site had a marked effect on the flowering phenology. Cushions inside the OTC started flowering substantially earlier than control cushions. Both the male and female phases developed faster in the OTCs, and maturation of capsules occurred earlier. The cushions also responded positively in reproductive terms and produced more mature seeds and had a higher seed/ovule ratio. After 1 year temperature enhancement at the alpine site there was a weak trend for earlier flowering, but there was no significant difference in seed production or seed/ovule ratio.},

However, only a few studies have evaluated whether these attempts are successful. 
2. We studied the effects of managing meadows according to the prescriptions of ecological compensation areas (ECA), the most widely adopted agri-environment
scheme in Switzerland, on both pollinator species richness and abundance, and the reproductive success of plants in nearby intensively managed meadows (IM).
3. We established arrays of four pots, each containing individuals of three insect pollinated, non-autogamous ‘phytometer’ species (Raphanus sativus, Hypochaeris radicata and Campanula glomerata), in ECA and adjacent IM at increasing distances from the ECA at 13 sites.
4. Species richness and abundance of hoverflies, solitary bees and large-sized pollinators (mainly social bees and butterflies) were significantly higher in ECA than in adjacent
IM. Species richness and abundance of small-sized pollinators in IM declined significantly with increasing distance from ECA, whereas large-sized pollinators were not
significantly affected by distance. Plant species richness and flower abundance were the major drivers of pollinator species richness and abundance; the area of an ECA had no
significant influence.
5. Individual plants of R. sativus and C. glomerata produced more and heavier seeds in ECA than in IM. Furthermore, the number of seeds of these two phytometer species was positively correlated with species richness and abundance of bees. No such effects were observed for individual plants of H. radicata . The number of fruits and seeds per
plant of R. sativus in IM decreased with increasing distance from ECA. 
6. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that establishing ECA is an effective method of enhancing both pollinator species richness and abundance and pollination services
to nearby intensely managed farmland. Our study emphasizes the importance of connectivity between ECA in maintaining diverse pollinator communities and thereby providing pollination services in agricultural landscapes.},

We tested whether this goal can be achieved in the case of the agri-environmental restoration scheme implemented for Swiss grassland using five large arthropod taxa (bees, true bugs, orthopterans, ground beetles and spiders) representing different ecological and functional groups. The species richness and abundance of all groups and species, respectively, was measured along 100m transects from ECA-meadows into the adjacent intensively managed grassland at 24 sites. Species richness of all arthropod taxa except ground beetles, and the abundance of 63% of the 234 arthropod species sampled with at least five individuals were higher in ECA-meadows than in their surroundings, while the total abundance of spiders and ground beetles was higher in intensively managed meadows. The abundance of 8% of these species were only increased in the ECA-meadows themselves (“stenotopic” species) but 40% had increased abundance both in the ECA-meadows and the adjacent grassland, declining exponentially with increasing distance from ECA-meadows (“edge species”). The 90%-decay distances for these edge species differed among taxonomic groups (117±18m for true bugs, 137±24m for spiders, 152±34m for bees, 167±5.7m for orthopterans, 185±34m for ground beetles; mean ±1 standard error) and independent of taxonomic group were larger for large-sized or predacious species than for small-sized or phytophagous species. Because the average distance between neighbouring ECA-meadows in Swiss grassland is only 73±4m, the current agri-environment scheme very likely enhances arthropod diversity and possibly associated ecosystem services in the Swiss agricultural landscape at large.},

The insect pollinator community was composed of 35 species in 3 orders and 14 families. Most of the bees (Hymenoptera) and a butterfly species (Lepidoptera) foraged for nectar, whereas all the flies (Diptera) foraged either for pollen or both nectar and pollen. Eight major pollinators were tested for their pollination efficiency. The nectar-robbing behavior of many species made it difficult to judge the efficiency of an insect on the basis of visitation rate and stay time; therefore, the amounts of pollen deposited and pollen harvested per visit were also measured. The single visit efficiency in terms of the number of seeds per pod revealed that Apis dorsata, A. florea, and Halictus sp. were superior for canola pollination, having Spears' values of 1.62, 1.55 and 1.73, respectively. With the increase in the number of seeds per pod, seed weight per pod also increased, confirming the importance of these three pollinator species in canola production.},

  volume    = {In press},
  abstract  = {Here we synthesize empirical research using meta-analysis to compare how consumer and resource fluxes affect recipient food webs. We tested the following hypotheses: H1) The direct effects of resource fluxes (bottom-up) should be stronger than the direct effects of consumer fluxes (top-down), because resource fluxes are permanent (do not return to the food web in which they were produced) but consumer fluxes may not be (consumers can leave). H2) Following H1, the indirect effects should attenuate (weaken) more quickly for consumer fluxes than for resource fluxes due to their direct effects being weaker. H3) The effects of resource fluxes should be stronger when recipient food webs are in different ecosystems than donor food webs due to differences in elevation that accompany cross-ecosystem food web interfaces, which should increase flux quantity due to gravity, while the effects of consumer fluxes should be stronger when donor and recipient food webs are in the same ecosystem as they should more easily assimilate into the recipient food web. We found no differences in the magnitude of bottom-up and top-down direct effects for resource and consumer fluxes, but top-down direct effects were 122% stronger than top-down indirect effects. Indirect effects of prey and predator fluxes quickly attenuated while indirect effects of non-prey resource and herbivore fluxes did not, as the overall direct effects of prey and predator fluxes were 123% and 163% stronger than their indirect effects, respectively. This result suggests that the magnitude of indirect effects decrease as the trophic level of resource and consumer fluxes increase, and also contrasts with results from studies showing in situ top-down indirect effects are stronger than in situ bottom-up indirect effects. We found that resource and consumer flux effect sizes were similar when they occurred between ecosystems, but when they occurred within ecosystems predator flux effects were 107% stronger than nutrient flux effects. Finally, we found that observational studies had higher effect sizes than manipulative studies. Future research should focus on how resource and consumer fluxes might interact and generate feedbacks in empirical studies of natural food webs, and what ecological factors might affect their relative strength.},

It is shown that the allocation of search has been optimal if and only if the “marginal cost” of additional food is equal throughout the foraging area when the period has elapsed. The model is used to predict the optimal area radius and allocation of search time. With realistic parameter values, the optimal time per unit area roughly decreases linearly with the distance from the central place.

  abstract  = {Establishing a good canola (rapeseed; Brassica napus L.) stand is difficult in the semiarid prairie region of Canada where low temperature, water stress, and soil crusting could result in poor seed bed conditions. A field study was conducted from 1999 to 2001 at Swift Current, SK, Canada, to determine the effect of a range of uniform (5 to 80 plants m-2) and nonuniform (seedlings from 1-m lengths from two adjoining rows were removed and retained alternatively; 10 to 40 plants m-2) plant populations on yield and yield components of canola. Canola adjusted seed yield across a wide range of plant populations, although it did not compensate completely for the decreasing populations. Environmental conditions played a significant role in the expression of plasticity of canola. For example, in 2000, with slightly above-normal growing season precipitation, canola maintained similar yield levels across a wide range of populations (20 to 80 plants m-2), while in 2001, with well below normal precipitation, seed yield declined as populations dropped below 40 plants m-2 Reducing plant population by half from 80 to 40 plants m-2 did not reduce seed yield when the reduced plant population was uniformly distributed, but reduced yield when the population was nonuniformly distributed. The primary response of canola to lower plant population was increased pods per plant through increased branching and increased pod retention at each node. The number of pods formed on primary and secondary branches increased as population decreased. Seeds per pod and seed weight were stable across populations.},

  abstract  = {Most models for the optimal allocation of foraging effort in space and time assume that food is distributed in distinct patches. This assumption is often not justified. The problem, therefore, is in finding the optimal strategy for an animal exploiting a resource with an arbitrary spatial distribution, whether or not it is patchy. In this paper, we deal with the situation of a one-dimensional habitat. The model describes the optimal allocation of time to each point of the habitat. It is a generalization to arbitrary habitats of the classical "marginal-value theorem," which is obtained as the special case of an infinite environment with equally spaced patches. The model can also be extended to describe the optimal distribution of a population, thereby generalizing the "ideal free distribution." The model predicts that foraging should be restricted to places where food availability is higher than some threshold. In these places only, the foraging activity should follow the spatial variations in richness. A field study on insectivorous bats illustrates the model's predictions. Finally, the model points to the difficulty of delimiting food patches when they need to be defined operationally, because a "patchy" distribution of consumers can overlie a continuous food distribution.},

We discuss the current taxonomic classification in light of the recent complete reworking of fungal systematics brought on by application of molecular methods. In addition, we discuss epidemiology and pathogenesis of the disease, as well as pathogen biology, morphology and reproduction. New attempts at disease control methods and management tactics are reviewed. We report on research tools developed for identification and monitoring, and also include recent findings on genomic and molecular studies not covered by previous reviews, including sequencing of the A. apis genome and identification of the mating type locus.},

In this study we assessed whether the density of feral honeybees, hoverflies (probably 2 species) and native bees (multiple species) in temperate Australian Brassica oilseed crops was related to the composition of the landscape. The density of pollinators was measured at multiple points in six different Brassica oilseed paddocks (20-80 ha) at least 1.75 km apart. Landscape composition at multiple scales (radii 100-2000 m) was determined from GIS layers of Brassica paddocks, woody vegetation and non-woody vegetation, and a derived layer expected to reflect the condition of woody vegetation remnants (the ‘Link’ score). Densities of feral honeybees were higher near the edges of Brassica fields than towards the middle. Densities of feral honeybees were strongly positively associated with the summed ‘Link’ score within 300m and with the amount of woody vegetation. Densities of native bees and hoverflies were not strongly associated with woody vegetation or with woody vegetation with a high ‘Link’ score. Our results suggest that maximising feral honeybee abundance within paddocks in these landscapes may require smaller paddocks than those typically used, interspersed with habitat beneficial to feral honeybees such as woody vegetation in good condition.},

Yet current evidence does not allow satisfactory assessment of the causes or consequences of pollen limitation. Here, we critically evaluate existing theory and issues concerning pollen limitation. Our main conclusion is that a change in approach is needed to determine whether pollen limitation reflects random fluctuations around a pollen-resource equilibrium, an adaptation to stochastic pollination
environments, or a chronic syndrome caused by an environmental perturbation. We formalize and extend D. Haig and M. Westoby’s conceptual model, and illustrate its use in
guiding research on the evolutionary consequences of pollen limitation, i.e., whether plants evolve or have evolved to ameliorate pollen limitation. This synthesis also reveals that we are only beginning to understand when and how pollen limitation at the plant level translates into effects on plant population dynamics. We highlight the need for both theoretical and empirical approaches to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of life-history characters, Allee effects, and environmental perturbations in population declines mediated by pollen limitation. Lastly, our synthesis identifies a critical need for research on potential effects of pollen limitation at the community and ecosystem levels.},

This would provide a density-dependent control of the output of young and could regulate the numbers of the birds.The peculiarities of long-lived sea-birds (e.g. clutches of one, long fledging periods, deferred maturity) which Wynne-Edwards suggests are adaptations evolved in order to lower the reproductive rate until it balances the mortality, apparently could not be evolved as such; they are more probably adaptations enabling the birds sometimes to raise single chicks in spite of competition for food that makes it impossible to raise more than one. It is considered that variation in the age of first breeding provides an important supplement to variation in reproductive success in regulating the numbers of long-lived tropical sea-birds.The possible applications of this hypothesis to sea-birds breeding in higher latitudes are briefly considered, as are its implications in relation to conservation and exploitation of populations of sea-birds.},

  Abstract                 = {Variation among the leaves, flowers, or fruit produced by a plant is often regarded as a nuisance to the experimenter and an impediment to selection. Here, we suggest that within-plant variation can drive selection on other plant-level traits. We examine within-plant variation in floral sex allocation and in fruit set, and predict that such variation generates variation in male success among plants, thereby driving selection on flowering time. We tested this prediction in a simulation model estimating selection on flowering time through male fitness when floral sex allocation and/or fruit set vary directionally among flowers on plants. We parameterized the model through a quantitative literature survey of within-plant change in sex allocation. As predicted, within-plant variation in floral sex allocation and in fruit set probability can generate selection on flowering time through male fitness. Declining fruit set from first to last flowers on plants, as occurs in many species, selected for early flowering onset through male fitness. This result was robust to self-incompatibility and to varying returns on male versus female investment. Selection caused by declining fruit set was strong enough to reverse the selection for late flowering that can be caused by intra-floral protandry. Our model provides testable predictions regarding selection on flowering time through male fitness. The model also establishes the intriguing possibility that within-plant variation may influence selection on other traits, regardless of whether that variation is under selection itself.This article is protected by copyright.

  abstract  = {Pollen dispersal is a critical process that shapes genetic diversity in natural populations of plants. Estimating the pollen dispersal curve can provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics of populations and is essential background for making predictions about changes induced by perturbations. Specifically, we would like to know whether the dispersal curve is exponential, thin-tailed (decreasing faster than exponential), or fat-tailed (decreasing slower than the exponential). In the latter case, rare events of long-distance dispersal will be much more likely. Here we generalize the previously developed twogener method, assuming that the pollen dispersal curve belongs to particular one- or two-parameter families of dispersal curves and estimating simultaneously the parameters of the dispersal curve and the effective density of reproducing individuals in the population. We tested this method on simulated data, using an exponential power distribution, under thin-tailed, exponential and fat-tailed conditions. We find that even if our estimates show some bias and large mean squared error (MSE), we are able to estimate correctly the general trend of the curve — thin-tailed or fat-tailed — and the effective density. Moreover, the mean distance of dispersal can be correctly estimated with low bias and MSE, even if another family of dispersal curve is used for the estimation. Finally, we consider three case studies based on forest tree species. We find that dispersal is fat-tailed in all cases, and that the effective density estimated by our model is below the measured density in two of the cases. This latter result may reflect the difficulty of estimating two parameters, or it may be a biological consequence of variance in reproductive success of males in the population. Both the simulated and empirical findings demonstrate the strong potential of twogener for evaluating the shape of the dispersal curve and the effective density of the population (de).},

Provided that mothers are sampled far enough apart ( ), Theta_ft becomes independent of and is then inversely proportional to the square of delta. Provided that this condition is fulfilled, delta is directly estimable from Theta_ft. Even when , estimation can easily be achieved via numerical evaluation. We show that the relation between Theta_ft and delta is only modestly affected by the shape of the distribution function, a result of importance, since this shape is generally unknown. We also study the impact of adult density within the population on Theta_ft, showing that to achieve the correct inference of delta from Theta_ft it must be taken into account, but that it has no effect on the distance at which mothers must be sampled.},

Here we present a lake sediment sequence from the Canadian Arctic that records warm periods of the past 200,000 years, including the 20th century. This record provides a perspective on recent changes in the Arctic and predates by approximately 80,000 years the oldest stratigraphically intact ice core recovered from the Greenland Ice Sheet. The early Holocene and the warmest part of the Last Interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage or MIS 5e) were the only periods of the past 200,000 years with summer temperatures comparable to or exceeding today's at this site. Paleoecological and geochemical data indicate that the past three interglacial periods were characterized by similar trajectories in temperature, lake biology, and lakewater pH, all of which tracked orbitally-driven solar insolation. In recent decades, however, the study site has deviated from this recurring natural pattern and has entered an environmental regime that is unique within the past 200 millennia.},

  abstract  = {Insect pollinators provide a crucial ecosystem service, but are under threat. Urban areas could be important for pollinators, though their value relative to other habitats is poorly known. We compared pollinator communities using quantified flower-visitation networks in 36 sites (each 1 km2) in three landscapes: urban, farmland and nature reserves. Overall, flower-visitor abundance and species richness did not differ significantly between the three landscape types. Bee abundance did not differ between landscapes, but bee species richness was higher in urban areas than farmland. Hoverfly abundance was higher in farmland and nature reserves than urban sites, but species richness did not differ significantly. While urban pollinator assemblages were more homogeneous across space than those in farmland or nature reserves, there was no significant difference in the numbers of rarer species between the three landscapes. Network-level specialization was higher in farmland than urban sites. Relative to other habitats, urban visitors foraged from a greater number of plant species (higher generality) but also visited a lower proportion of available plant species (higher specialization), both possibly driven by higher urban plant richness. Urban areas are growing, and improving their value for pollinators should be part of any national strategy to conserve and restore pollinators.pp},

  abstract  = {This review examines the direct effects of climate change on insect herbivores. Temperature is identified as the dominant abiotic factor directly affecting herbivorous insects. There is little evidence of any direct effects of CO2 or UVB. Direct impacts of precipitation have been largely neglected in current research on climate change. Temperature directly affects development, survival, range and abundance. Species with a large geographical range will tend to be less affected. The main effect of temperature in temperate regions is to influence winter survival; at more northerly latitudes, higher temperatures extend the summer season, increasing the available thermal budget for growth and reproduction. Photoperiod is the dominant cue for the seasonal synchrony of temperate insects, but their thermal requirements may differ at different times of year. Interactions between photoperiod and temperature determine phenology; the two factors do not necessarily operate in tandem. Insect herbivores show a number of distinct life-history strategies to exploit plants with different growth forms and strategies, which will be differentially affected by climate warming. There are still many challenges facing biologists in predicting and monitoring the impacts of climate change. Future research needs to consider insect herbivore phenotypic and genotypic flexibility, their responses to global change parameters operating in concert, and awareness that some patterns may only become apparent in the longer term.},

  Abstract                 = {Flowering plants possess an unrivaled diversity of mechanisms for
achieving sexual and asexual reproduction, often simultaneously.
The commonest type of asexual reproduction is clonal growth
(vegetative propagation) in which parental genotypes (genets)
produce vegetative modules (ramets) that are capable of independent
growth, reproduction, and often dispersal. Clonal growth
leads to an expansion in the size of genets and increased fitness
because large floral displays increase fertility and opportunities
for outcrossing. Moreover, the clonal dispersal of vegetative
propagules can assist “mate finding,” particularly in aquatic plants.
However, there are ecological circumstances in which functional
antagonism between sexual and asexual reproductive modes can
negatively affect the fitness of clonal plants. Populations of heterostylous
and dioecious species have a small number of mating
groups (two or three), which should occur at equal frequency in
equilibrium populations. Extensive clonal growth and vegetative
dispersal can disrupt the functioning of these sexual polymorphisms,
resulting in biased morph ratios and populations with a
single mating group, with consequences for fertility and mating.
In populations in which clonal propagation predominates, mutations
reducing fertility may lead to sexual dysfunction and even
the loss of sex. Recent evidence suggests that somatic mutations
can play a significant role in influencing fitness in clonal plants and
may also help explain the occurrence of genetic diversity in sterile
clonal populations. Highly polymorphic genetic markers offer outstanding
opportunities for gaining novel insights into functional interactions
between sexual and clonal reproduction in flowering plants.},

We present a long-term study of relative rates of change for an entire regional bee fauna in the northeastern United States, based on >30,000 museum records representing 438 species. Over a 140-y period, aggregate native species richness weakly decreased, but richness declines were significant only for the genus Bombus. Of 187 native species analyzed individually, only three declined steeply, all of these in the genus Bombus. However, there were large shifts in community composition, as indicated by 56% of species showing significant changes in relative abundance over time. Traits associated with a declining relative abundance include small dietary and phenological breadth and large body size. In addition, species with lower latitudinal range boundaries are increasing in relative abundance, a finding that may represent a response to climate change. We show that despite marked increases in human population density and large changes in anthropogenic land use, aggregate native species richness declines were modest outside of the genus Bombus. At the same time, we find that certain ecological traits are associated with declines in relative abundance. These results should help target conservation efforts focused on maintaining native bee abundance and diversity and therefore the important ecosystems services that they provide.},

We report that over the past 130 y, the phenology of 10 bee species from northeastern North America has ad vanced by a mean of 10.4+1.3 d. Most of this advance has taken place since 1970, paralleling global temperature increases. When the best available data are used to estimate analogous rates of advance for plants, these rates are not distinguishable from those of bees, suggesting that bee emergence is keeping pace with shifts in host-plant flowering, at least among the generalist species that we investigated.},

We used 15 winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) fields in Sweden to study how variation among fields in pollinator visitation rates, pollen beetle attack rates and soil properties (soil texture, pH and organic carbon) interactively determined crop yield. The fields were embedded in a landscape gradient with contrasting proportions of arable and semi-natural land. In general, pollinator visitation and pest levels were negatively correlated and varied independently of soil properties. This may reflect that above- and below-ground processes react at landscape and local spatial scales, respectively. The above-ground biotic interactions and below-ground abiotic factors interactively affected crop yield. Pollinator visitation was the strongest predictor positively associated with yield. High soil pH also benefited yield, but only at lower pest loads. Surprisingly, high pest loads increased the pollinator benefits for yield. Implementing management plans at different spatial scales can create synergies among above- and below-ground ecosystem processes, but both scales are needed given that different processes react at different spatial scales.},

However, high levels of biodiversity might buffer the negative effects of species-specific phenological shifts and maintain synchrony at the community level, as predicted by the biodiversity insurance hypothesis. Here, we explore how biodiversity might enhance and stabilise phenological synchrony between a valuable crop, apple and its native pollinators. We combine 46 years of data on apple flowering phenology with historical records of bee pollinators over the same period. When the key apple pollinators are considered altogether, we found extensive synchrony between bee activity and apple peak bloom due to complementarity among bee species’ activity periods, and also a stable trend over time due to differential responses to warming climate among bee species. A simulation model confirms that high biodiversity levels can ensure plant-pollinator phenological synchrony and thus pollination function.},
  comment   = {Found that emergence times of bees (day of first collection) and date of mid-bloom for apple trees were generally synchronized, and that even though some bee species have become less synchronized, the overall community has remained synchronized (i.e. slope is zero). Found that diversity contributes to overall synchronization b/w plants and pollinators

However:
- Doesn't really say which spp are the most important pollinators. Perhaps better pollinators are becoming desynchronized?
- Crude measure of emergence day (but not much of a way around that, given the historical dataset)
- Doesn't really "prove" that diversity contributes to overall synchronization, but simulation is about as good as it gets in this case.},

These mutualistic interactions often involve dozens or even hundreds of species that form complex networks of interdependences. Understanding how coevolution proceeds in these highly diversified mutualisms among free-living species presents a conceptual challenge. Recent work has led to the unambiguous conclusion that mutualistic networks are very heterogeneous (the bulk of the species have a few interactions, but a few species are much more connected than expected by chance), nested (specialists interact with subsets of the species with which generalists interact), and built on weak and asymmetric links among species. Both ecological variables (e.g., phenology, local abundance, and geographic range) and past evolutionary history may explain such network patterns. Network structure has important implications for the coexistence and stability of species as well as for the coevolutionary process. Mutualistic networks can thus be regarded as the architecture of biodiversity.},

We test with meta-analysis whether the benefits of AEM for species richness and abundance of plants and animals are determined by the surrounding landscape context. Across all studies (109 observations for species richness and 114 observations for abundance), AEM significantly increased species richness and their abundance. More specifically, we test the hypothesis that AEM benefits species richness and abundance (i.e. increases the difference between fields with and without AEM) more in simple than in complex landscapes. In croplands, species richness but not abundance was significantly enhanced in simple but not in complex landscapes. In grasslands, AEM effectively enhanced species richness and abundance regardless of landscape context. Pollinators were significantly enhanced by AEM in simple but not in complex landscapes in both croplands and grasslands. Our results highlight that the one-size-fits-all approach of many agri-environmental programmes is not an efficient way of spending the limited funds available for biodiversity conservation on farmland. Therefore, we conclude that AEM should be adapted to landscape structure and the species groups at which they are targeted.},

Among the multiple pressures facing pollinators2-4, decreasing floral resources due to habitat loss and degradation has been suggested as a key contributing factor2-8. However, a lack of
quantitative data has hampered testing for historical changes in floral resources. Here we show that overall floral rewards can be estimated at a national scale by combining vegetation surveys and direct nectar measurements. We find evidence for substantial losses in nectar resources in England and Wales between the 1930s and 1970s; however, total nectar provision in Great Britain as a whole had stabilized by 1978, and increased from 1998 to 2007. These findings concur with trends in pollinator diversity, which declined in the mid-twentieth century9 but stabilized more recently10. The diversity of nectar sources declined from 1978 to 1990 and thereafter in some habitats, with four plant species accounting for over 50% of national nectar provision in 2007. Calcareous grassland, broadleaved woodland and neutral grassland are the habitats that produce the greatest amount of nectar per unit area from the most diverse sources, whereas arable land is the poorest with respect to amount of nectar per unit area and diversity of nectar sources. Although agri-environment schemes add resources to arable landscapes, their national contribution is low. Owing to their large area, improved grasslands could add substantially to national nectar provision if they were managed to increase floral resource provision. This national-scale assessment of floral resource provision affords new insights into the links between plant and pollinator declines, and offers considerable opportunities for conservation.},

  abstract  = {The grasses represent one of the most important families of plants since they constitute our major crops and pastures and dominate many natural ecosystems. Self-incompatibility (SI) is widespread in the grasses and is under the control of a series of alleles at each of two unlinked loci, S and Z. Specification of the pollen grain is gametophytic and depends upon the combination of S and Z alleles in the pollen grain. Both of these must be matched in the pistil for the pollen grain to be incompatible. Several lines of research suggest that this two-locus SI system is shared by all grass species of the Pooideae and possibly by the entire Graminae. Firstly, genetic studies demonstrated the presence of the S-Z system in the Triticeae, the Poeae and Avenae. Secondly, linkage analyses showed common markers linked to the S-gene in grass species from all three tribes. Recent molecular studies revealed remarkable synteny of chromosomes and conservation of gene order within the Poaceae. Molecular markers have also been used to confirm syntenous localization of S and Z in several species. Despite the complexity of the grass incompatibility system relative to that in other families, the detailed genetic and physical maps for the crop species in the Triticeae and the availability of large insert libraries and mutations at the incompatibility loci, makes this a particularly promising family for molecular studies.},

Aggregate magnitudes of annual growth and total plant mass by thermal belts and their bioclimatic regions follow a sequence of alternating high values in humid regions and low values in arid regions that bears a similarity to the periodic law of geographical zonality. Maximum plant production is associated with the Tropical belt, where combinations of heat and moisture favor maximum intensity of the physical-geographic process.

The median distance foraged was 6.1 km, and the mean 5.5 km. Only 10% of the bees foraged within 0.5 km of the hive whereas 50% went more than 6 km, 25% more than 7.5 km and 10% more than 9.5 km from the hive.
2.These results are in sharp contrast with previous studies in which foraging distances were much closer to the hive. In May 1997 the mean foraging distance was 1 km, showing that long-range dancing is not the rule in Sheffield.
3.The observed foraging distances described in this study may not be exceptional in a patchy environment where differences in patch size and patch quality are large. When travel distances to patches are large, distant patches can probably be utilized only by individuals that live in groups and recruit foragers to the patches found. Only then are the benefits of scouting for distant patches high enough to enable the exploitation of these patches.},

2. Even though the colonies were located in the same environment and had the same genetic background, foragers from different colonies used different forage patches.
3. Small and large colonies foraged at a similar distance in July when forage was abundant (mean foraging distance for small and large colonies was 0.67 and 0.62 km, respectively) whereas the large colonies foraged significantly further in August when forage was scarce (mean foraging distance for small and large colonies was 1.43 and 2.85 km, respectively).
4. Small colonies foraged at approximately the same number of patches as large colonies. The total number of foragers returning to the small colonies per minute was significantly lower than the number of foragers returning to the large colonies. This means that, relative to their size, small colonies foraged at more patches than large colonies.
5. The quality of the nectar collected by foragers of the small and large colonies did not differ. However, small colonies did collect more pollen than large colonies.},

These include the log-normal distribution of abundance, the relation between range and abundance, the species-area law, and the turnover of species composition. Each pattern is the subject of a large literature that interprets it in terms of ecological processes, typically involving the sorting of differently specialized species onto heterogeneous landscapes. All of these patterns can be shown to arise, however, from neutral community models in which all individuals have identical properties, as the consequence of local dispersal alone. This implies, at the least, that functional interpretations of these patterns must be reevaluated. More fundamentally, neutral community models provide a general theory for biodiversity and conservation biology capable of predicting the fundamental processes and patterns of community ecology.},

Field germination percentages of nine species varied between 0 and 40\% over 2 yr. Controlled environment tests suggested that low temperatures and slow imbibition were responsible for poor field germination. Annual seedling survival varied between 0 and 96\% depending upon species, site, and year. Most seedling deaths appeared to result from summer drought. Reproduction by seed is a rare event in these polar semidesert environments, yet vegetative reproduction is also uncommon. Most seedlings become established in moss or lichen mats and desiccation cracks where summer moisture is more constant.},

Various correlation structures related to autoregression and/or subject heterogeneity were used to simulate, most of which did not correspond to any of the methods being assessed and so induced some model misspecification. We evaluated validity (Type I error rate) and efficiency (power) for the interaction effect using several methods based on generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) or generalized estimating equations (GEE). Conclusions included that Type I error rates were too high for GEE using sandwich standard errors, and too low for GLMM. Generally, Type I error rate was improved with more subjects but not with more measurements per subjects, and both improved power. Many of our results differ from corresponding results in other cases (e.g. logistic models), emphasizing a diversity of behaviour for various non-normal outcomes.},

  abstract  = {We evaluated the conditions under which patch size effects are important determinants of local population density for animals living in patchy landscapes. This information was used to predict when patch size effects will be expected to occur following habitat loss and fragmentation. Using meta-analysis, we quantitatively reviewed the results of 25 published studies that tested for a relationship between patch size and population density. Patch size effects were strong for edge and interior species (negative and postive patch size effects, respectively), but negligible for generalist species that use both edge and interior habitat. We found significant differences in mean patch size effects between migratory and residential species, between herbivores and carnivores, and among taxonomic groups. We found no evidence that patch size effects were related to landscape characteristics such as the proportion of landscape covered by habitat, median patch size, or the scale at which a study was conducted. However, species in the Western Hemisphere tended to have larger absolute effect sizes, and eastern species tended to be more variable in their response. For landscapes undergoing habitat loss and fragmentation, our results predict the following: 
(1) among generalist species that use both the edge and the interior of a habitat patch, the decline in population size associated with habitat destruction should be accounted for by pure habitat loss alone; 
(2) for interior species, the decline in population size associated with habitat fragmentation per se will be greater than that predicted from pure habitat loss alone; 
(3) for edge species, the decline in population size will be less than that predicted by pure habitat loss alone;
(4) these relative effects will not be influenced by the extent of habitat loss, but they will be affected by the pattern of habitat when large or small patches are preferentially removed; and 
(5) as loss and fragmentation increase within a landscape, migratory species will generally suffer less of a decline in population size than resident species.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze perturbation experiments performed on real and idealized ecological communities.
A community may be considered as a black box in the sense that the individual species
grow and interact in complicated ways that are difficult to discern. Yet, by observing the response
(output) of the system to natural or human-induced disturbances (inputs), information can be gained
regarding the character and strengths of species interactions. We define a perturbation as selective
alteration of the density of one or more members of the community, and we distinguish two quite
different kinds of perturbations. A PULSE perturbation is a relatively instantaneous alteration of
species numbers, after which the system is studied as it "relaxes" back to its previous equilibrium
state. A PRESS perturbation is a sustained alteration of species densities (often a complete elimination
of particular species); it is maintained until the unperturbed species reach a new equilibrium. The
measure of interest in PRESS perturbation is the net change in densities of the unperturbed species.
There is a very important difference between these two approaches: PULSE experiments yield information
only on direct interactions (e.g., terms in the interaction matrix), while PRESS experiments
yield information on direct interactions mixed together with the indirect effects mediated through
other species in the community. We develop mathematical techniques that yield measures of ecological
interaction between species from both types of experimental designs. Particular caution must be
exercised in interpreting results from PRESS experiments, particularly when some species are lumped
into functional categories and others are neglected altogether in the experimental design. We also
suggest mathematical methods to deal with temporal and random variation during experiments. Finally,
we critically review techniques that rely on natural variation in numbers to estimate species
interaction coefficients. The problems with such studies are formidable.},

  abstract  = {1. Ecosystem services to agriculture, such as pollination, rely on natural areas adjacent to farmland to support organisms that provide services. Native insect pollinators depend on natural or semi-natural land surrounding farms for nesting and alternative foraging resources. Despite interest in conserving pollinators through habitat restoration, the scale at which land use affects pollinators and thus crop pollination services is not well understood. 
2. We measured abundance of native, wild bee pollinators and the pollination services they provided to highbush blueberry Vaccinium corymbosum L. crops at 16 sites that varied in the proportion of surrounding agricultural land cover at both the field scale (300-m radius) and the landscape scale (1500-m radius). We designed our study such that agricultural land cover at the field scale was uncorrelated with agricultural cover at the landscape scale across sites. We used model selection to determine which spatial scale better predicted aggregate bee abundance, abundance of large versus small bees and crop pollination services.
3. We found that, overall, bees responded more strongly to field-scale than to landscape-scale land cover, but the scale at which land cover had the strongest effect varied by bee body size. Large bees showed a negative response to increasing agricultural cover at both scales, but were most strongly affected by the landscape scale. Small bees were negatively affected by agricultural land cover but only at the field scale, while they had a small positive response to agricultural cover at the landscape scale.
4. Aggregate pollination services from native bees were more strongly influenced by fieldscale agricultural cover, due to the combined effects of both large and small bees responding at that scale.
5. Synthesis and applications. Bee abundance and pollination services were strongly determined by field-scale agricultural cover, suggesting that field-scale set-asides may provide significant benefits to pollination services. Further, we found that pollinators respond differently to land use depending on body size, but all groups of bees benefit from decreasing agricultural cover at the field scale. Therefore, small-scale modifications to habitat can have significant impacts on both pollinator abundance and pollination services to crop plants.},

The changes in agricultural practices affect many different aspects of the farmland habitat, but agricultural industry, policy and much previous research has tended to be concerned with specific sectors or practices (e.g. pesticide use or cereal husbandry). Here, we review the empirical literature to synthesize the research effort that has been directed to investigate specific practices or goals to make general statements regarding the causes and consequences of farmland biodiversity decline. We argue that the loss of ecological heterogeneity at multiple spatial and temporal scales is a universal consequence of multivariate agricultural intensification and, therefore, that future research should develop cross-cutting policy frameworks and management solutions that recreate that heterogeneity as the key to restoring and sustaining biodiversity in temperate agricultural systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of weather on the flight and flower-visiting activity of bumblebees and butterflies were studied at a sub{Arctic}-alpine site in northern Swedish Lapland. The study focused on the insects' role as potential pollinators and the effect of bumblebee flight and foraging activity on plant reproductive success. The activity rates of both bumblebees and butterflies were significantly correlated with ambient air temperature and solar radiation, and as a consequence, both bumblebees and butterflies exhibited a regular diurnal activity pattern. The butterflies' activity was more constrained by low temperature and solar radiation then the bumblebees' activity, and small worker bees were more affected by the weather than the larger queens. Only 1\% of the butterflies observed were visiting flowers, as compared to 69\% of the bumblebees. Thus, butterflies seem to be less important pollinators for the {Alpine} plant community than bumblebees. Short-term micrometeorological impact on the reproduction of two bumblebee-pollinated plant species, Bartsia alpina and Diapensia lapponica, was also studied. In both species, reproductive success, measured as seed production, was significantly reduced during a spell of cold weather in comparison to a warmer period.},

  Abstract                 = {Alpine ecosystems are particularly expected to experience changes due to temperature rise, but little is known how insect herbivory may respond to that process. I used two already established study sites at different elevations with control plots and Open Top Chambers (OTCs) in a Dryas octopetala heath in the {Alpine} ecosystem of Finse, southwestern Norway, to investigate whether experimental warming does affect insect herbivory. Leaf feeding damage was recorded in early and late summer and number of insect herbivores counted by searching the plots; pitfall traps were used to map other potential insect herbivores in the area. General Linear Models (GLMs) were used to examine the effects. Experimental warming increased the total amount of insect herbivory, mainly due to plant species Dryas octopetala and Bistorta vivipara. Most insect herbivores were Lepidoptera and Zygaena exulans was the most abundant species. Larvae of Z. exulans were found in higher number inside as compared to outside the OTCs. The pitfall traps indicated other potential insect herbivores. This study suggests that some plant species such as Dryas octopetala and Bistorta vivipara, are more susceptible than others to insect herbivores with temperature rise. Concluding that insect herbivory may have important impact on species composition and ecosystem functions.},

  abstract  = {(1) The theoretical distribution of non-omniscient predators in a heterogeneous multi-patch environment is studied by numerical simulation. Although various relative densities are explored, we mostly attend to environments where prey density is approximately one order of magnitude higher than predator density. (2) Predators are assumed to follow the rule of abandoning their current patch when local capture rate is lower than estimated capture rate in the environment as a whole. This rule was chosen because it is known to maximize long-term capture rate in many foraging situations. For convenience, we assume that after abandoning a patch, predators arrive at random at any patch in the environment. (3) Predators detect precisely the capture rate in their current patch but `learn' about the environmental average. Learning is simulated using a linear operator model which estimates global capture rate as a weighted average of past and current experienced capture rate. Following a common approach is psychological models of simple learning, the relative weight of past and present capture rate is controlled by a parameter denominated the `memory factor'. (4) In the absence of depletion, the predators distribute themselves close to the predictions of the Ideal Free Distribution model. This result indicates that the IFD prediction is not dependent on assuming omniscient predation, but instead can be jointly derived from reasonable assumptions about learning and optimal foraging at individual level. (5) When the environment depletes as a consequence of predation, cumulative prey mortality can be positively or negatively density-dependent, depending on the interaction between predator efficiency and the velocity of the learning process as determined by the memory factor. (6) The learning model converges towards the IFD faster than `omniscient' variants in which the predators, instead of using a learned estimate and migrating `blindly' to any patch, use the true environmental average for the migration decision and migrate only to patches with capture rate higher than their current capture rate. (7) Both spatial and temporal between-patch variance in prey density affect the behaviour of our model.},

  abstract  = {Understanding the mechanisms enabling coevolution in complex mutualistic networks remains a central challenge in evolutionary biology. We show for the first time, to our knowledge, that a tropical plant species has the capacity to discriminate among floral visitors, investing in reproduction differentially across the pollinator community. After we standardized pollen quality in 223 aviary experiments, successful pollination of Heliconia tortuosa (measured as pollen tube abundance) occurred frequently when plants were visited by long-distance traplining hummingbird species with specialized bills (pollen tubes = 1.21 ± 0.12 SE) but was reduced 5.7 times when visited by straight-billed territorial birds (pollen tubes = 0.20 ± 0.074 SE) or insects. Our subsequent experiments revealed that plants use the nectar extraction capacity of tropical hummingbirds, a positive function of bill length, as a cue to turn on reproductively. Furthermore, we show that hummingbirds with long bills and high nectar extraction efficiency engaged in daily movements at broad spatial scales (~1 km), but that territorial species moved only short distances (<100 m). Such pollinator recognition may therefore affect mate selection and maximize receipt of high-quality pollen from multiple parents. Although a diffuse pollinator network is implied, because all six species of hummingbirds carry pollen of H. tortuosa, only two species with specialized bills contribute meaningfully to its reproduction. We hypothesize that this pollinator filtering behavior constitutes a crucial mechanism facilitating coevolution in multispecies plant-pollinator networks. However, pollinator recognition also greatly reduces the number of realized pollinators, thereby rendering mutualistic networks more vulnerable to environmental change.},

By studying bee and hoverfly assemblages in Britain and the Netherlands, we found evidence of declines (pre-versus post-1980) in local bee diversity in both countries; however, divergent trends were observed in hoverflies. Depending on the assemblage and location, pollinator declines were most frequent in habitat and flower specialists, in univoltine species, and/or in nonmigrants. In conjunction with this evidence, outcrossing plant species that are reliant on the declining pollinators have themselves declined relative to other plant species. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest a causal connection between local extinctions of functionally linked plant and pollinator species.},

Small groups of foragers were monitored from time of orientation flights to time of death and all in-hive behaviors relating to foraging were recorded. In the context of a novice forager finding her first food source, 60\% of the bees relied, at least in part, on acquiring information from waggle dances (being recruited) rather than searching independently (scouting). In the context of an experienced forager whose foraging has been interrupted, 37\% of the time the bees resumed foraging by following waggle dances (being reactivated) rather than examining the food source on their own (inspecting). And in the context of an experienced forager engaged in foraging, 17\% of the time the bees initiated a foraging trip by following a waggle dance. Such dance following was observed much more often after an unsuccessful than after a successful foraging trip. Successful foragers often followed dances just briefly, perhaps to confirm that the kind of flowers they had been visiting were still yielding forage. Overall, waggle dance following for food discovery accounted for 12--25\% of all interactions with dancers (9\% by novice foragers and 3--16\% by experienced foragers) whereas dance following for reactivation and confirmation accounted for the other 75--88\% (26\% for reactivation and 49--62\% for confirmation). We conclude that foragers make extensive use of the waggle dance not only to start work at new, unfamiliar food sources but also to resume work at old, familiar food sources.},

We recorded feeding marks on the most common vascular plant species in warmed and control plots at two experimental sites at different elevations and carried out a brief inventory of insect herbivores. Experimental warming increased herbivory on Dryas octopetala and Bistorta vivipara. Dryas octopetala also experienced increased herbivory at the lower and warmer site, indicating an overall positive effect of warming, whereas B. vivipara experienced an increased herbivory at the colder and higher site indicating a mixed effect of warming. The Lepidoptera Zygaena exulans and Sympistis nigrita were the two most common leaf-chewing insects in the Dryas heath. Based on the observed patterns of herbivory, the insects life cycles and feeding preferences, we argue that Z. exulans is the most important herbivore on B. vivipara, and S. nigrita the most important herbivore on D. octopetala. We conclude that if the degree of insect herbivory increases in a warmer world, as suggested by this study and others, complex interactions between plants, insects, and site-specific conditions make it hard to predict overall effects on plant communities.},

  abstract  = {Recent changes in climate have led to significant shifts in phenology, with many studies demonstrating advanced phenology in response to warming temperatures. The rate of temperature change is especially high in the Arctic, but this is also where we have relatively little data on phenological changes and the processes driving these changes. In order to understand how Arctic plant species are likely to respond to future changes in climate, we monitored flowering phenology in response to both experimental and ambient warming for four widespread species in two habitat types over 21 years. We additionally used long-term environmental records to disentangle the effects of temperature increase and changes in snowmelt date on phenological patterns. While flowering occurred earlier in response to experimental warming, plants in unmanipulated plots showed no change or a delay in flowering over the 21-year period, despite more than 1 °C of ambient warming during that time. This counterintuitive result was likely due to significantly delayed snowmelt over the study period (0.05-0.2 days/yr) due to increased winter snowfall. The timing of snowmelt was a strong driver of flowering phenology for all species - especially for early-flowering species - while spring temperature was significantly related to flowering time only for later-flowering species. Despite significantly delayed flowering phenology, the timing of seed maturation showed no significant change over time, suggesting that warmer temperatures may promote more rapid seed development. The results of this study highlight the importance of understanding the specific environmental cues that drive species’ phenological responses as well as the complex interactions between temperature and precipitation when forecasting phenology over the coming decades. As demonstrated here, the effects of altered snowmelt patterns can counter the effects of warmer temperatures, even to the point of generating phenological responses opposite to those predicted by warming alone.x},

  Abstract                 = {Climatic changes due to anthropogenic activity are predicted to have a profound effect on the world’s biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The response of natural communities to climate change will depend primarily on two factors: 1) the ability of species to adapt quickly to changing temperatures and precipitation trends, and 2) the ability of species and populations from southern latitudes to migrate northward and establish in new environments. The assumption is often made that species and populations will track their optimal climate northward as the earth warms, but this assumption ignores a host of other potentially important factors, including the lack of adaptation to photoperiod, soil moisture, and biotic interactions at higher latitudes. In this study, we aim to better understand the ability of southern populations to establish and grow at northern latitudes under warmer temperatures. We collected seeds or ramets of three Arctic plant species (Papaver radicatum, Oxyria digyna, and Arctagrostis latifolia) from {Alexandra Fiord} on Ellesmere Island, Canada and from southern populations at Cornwallis Island, Canada, Barrow, Alaska, and Latnjajaure, Sweden. These seeds were planted into experimentally warmed and control plots at {Alexandra Fiord} in 2011. We have tracked their survival, phenology, and growth over two growing seasons. Here, we will present the preliminary results of these experiments. In particular, we will discuss whether individuals originating from southern latitudes exhibit higher growth rates in warm plots than control plots, and whether southern populations survive and grow as well as or better than individuals from {Alexandra Fiord} in the warmed plots. In both cases, a positive response would indicate that a warming climate may facilitate a migration northward of more southerly species or populations, and that the lack of adaptation to local conditions (soil chemistry, microhabitat, etc.) will not limit this migration. Alternately, a negative response may indicate a need to reassess our fundamental assumptions about species migrations in response to climate change.},

  abstract  = {Pollination services from wild insects contribute to crop productivity around the world, but are at risk of decline in agricultural landscapes. Using highbush blueberry as a model system, we tested whether wildflower plantings established adjacent to crop fields would increase the abundance of wild pollinators during crop bloom and enhance pollination and yield.

Plantings were seeded in 2009 with a mix of 15 perennial wildflower species that provided season-long bloom and increased plant density and floral area during the subsequent 3 years.

Honeybees visiting blueberry flowers had similar abundance in enhanced and control fields in all 4 years of this study, whereas wild bee and syrphid abundance increased annually in the fields adjacent to wildflower plantings.

Crop pollination parameters including percentage fruit set, berry weight and mature seeds per berry were significantly greater in fields adjacent to wildflower plantings 3 and 4 years after seeding, leading to higher crop yields and with the associated revenue exceeding the cost of wildflower establishment and maintenance.

Synthesis and applications. We suggest that provision of forage habitat for bees adjacent to pollinator-dependent crops can conserve wild pollinators in otherwise resource-poor agricultural landscapes. Over time, these plantings can support higher crop yields and bring a return on the initial investment in wildflower seed and planting establishment, also insuring against loss of managed pollinators. Further understanding of the importance of planting size, location and landscape context will be required to effectively implement this practice to support crop pollination.},

  abstract  = {Neonicotinoid insecticides are successfully applied to control pests in a variety of agricultural crops; however, they may not only affect pest insects but also non-target organisms such as pollinators. This review summarizes, for the first time, 15 years of research on the hazards of neonicotinoids to bees including honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees. The focus of the paper is on three different key aspects determining the risks of neonicotinoid field concentrations for bee populations: (1) the environmental neonicotinoid residue levels in plants, bees and bee products in relation to pesticide application, (2) the reported side-effects with special attention for sublethal effects, and (3) the usefulness for the evaluation of neonicotinoids of an already existing risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds. Although environmental residue levels of neonicotinoids were found to be lower than acute/chronic toxicity levels, there is still a lack of reliable data as most analyses were conducted near the detection limit and for only few crops. Many laboratory studies described lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on the foraging behavior, and learning and memory abilities of bees, while no effects were observed in field studies at field-realistic dosages. The proposed risk assessment scheme for systemic compounds was shown to e applicable to assess the risk for side-effects of neonicotinoids as it considers the effect on different life stages and different levels of biological organization (organism versus colony). Future research studies should be conducted with field-realistic concentrations, relevant exposure and evaluation durations. Molecular markers may be used to improve risk assessment by a better understanding of the mode of action (interaction with receptors) of neonicotinoids in bees leading to the identification of environmentally safer compounds.},

We found that pollen germination and tube growth were dependent on pollen density in both liquid and solid medium. Pollen germination rates were not substantially affected by flower or plant age. The quartet1 mutation negatively affected pollen germination, especially in the Ler ecotype. This protocol will facilitate functional analyses of insertional mutants affecting male gametophyte function, and should allow detailed gene expression analyses during pollen tube growth. Arabidopsis thaliana can now be included on the list of plant species that are suitable models for physiological studies of pollen tube elongation and tip growth.},

  Abstract                 = {Environmental manipulation studies are integral to determining biological consequences of climate warming. Open Top Chambers (OTCs) have been widely used to assess summer warming effects on terrestrial biota, with their effects during other seasons normally being given less attention even though chambers are often deployed year-round. In addition, their effects on temperature extremes and freeze-thaw events are poorly documented. To provide robust documentation of the microclimatic influences of OTCs throughout the year, we analysed temperature data from 20 studies distributed across polar and {Alpine} regions. The effects of OTCs on mean temperature showed a large range (-0.9 to 2.1 °C) throughout the year, but did not differ significantly between studies. Increases in mean monthly and diurnal temperature were strongly related (R2 = 0.70) with irradiance, indicating that PAR can be used to predict the mean warming effect of OTCs. Deeper snow trapped in OTCs also induced higher temperatures at soil/vegetation level. OTC-induced changes in the frequency of freeze-thaw events included an increase in autumn and decreases in spring and summer. Frequency of high-temperature events in OTCs increased in spring, summer and autumn compared with non-manipulated control plots. Frequency of low-temperature events was reduced by deeper snow accumulation and higher mean temperatures. The strong interactions identified between aspects of ambient environmental conditions and effects of OTCs suggest that a detailed knowledge of snow depth, temperature and irradiance levels enables us to predict how OTCs will modify the microclimate at a particular site and season. Such predictive power allows a better mechanistic understanding of observed biotic response to experimental warming studies and for more informed design of future experiments. However, a need remains to quantify OTC effects on water availability and wind speed (affecting, for example, drying rates and water stress) in combination with microclimate measurements at organism level.},

  Abstract                 = {Habitat loss poses a major threat to biodiversity, and species-specific extinction risks are inextricably
linked to life-history characteristics. This relationship is still poorly documented for many functionally
important taxa, and at larger continental scales. With data from five replicated field studies from three
countries, we examined how species richness of wild bees varies with habitat patch size. We hypothesized
that the form of this relationship is affected by body size, degree of host plant specialization and sociality.
Across all species, we found a positive species-area slope (z = 0.19), and species traits modified this
relationship. Large-bodied generalists had a lower z value than small generalists. Contrary to predictions,
small specialists had similar or slightly lower z value compared with large specialists, and small generalists
also tended to be more strongly affected by habitat loss as compared with small specialists. Social bees
were negatively affected by habitat loss (z = 0.11) irrespective of body size. We conclude that habitat
loss leads to clear shifts in the species composition of wild bee communities.},

  abstract  = {The relationships between landscape intensification, the abundance and diversity of pollinating insects, and their contributions to crop yield, quality, and market value are poorly studied, despite observed declines in wild and domesticated pollinators. Abundance and species richness of pollinating insects were estimated in ten fields of spring oilseed rape, Brassica napus var. SW StratosTM, located along a gradient of landscape compositions ranging from simple landscapes dominated by arable land to heterogeneous landscapes with extensive cover of semi-natural habitats. In each field, we assessed the contribution of wind and insect pollination to seed yield, seed quality (individual seed weight and oil and chlorophyll contents), and market value in a block experiment with four replicates and two treatments: (1) all flowers were accessible to insects, self and wind pollination, and (2) flowers enclosed in tulle net bags (mesh: 1 9 1 mm) were accessible only to wind and self pollination. Complex landscapes enhanced the overall abundance of wild insects as well as the abundance and species richness of hoverflies. This did not translate to a higher yield, probably due to consistent pollination by honey bees across all fields. However, the pollination experiment showed that insects increased seed weight per plant by 18% and market value by 20%. Seed quality was enhanced by insect pollination, rendering heavier seeds as well as higher oil and lower chlorophyll contents, clearly showing that insect pollination is required to reach high seed yield and quality in oilseed rape. Our study demonstrates considerable and previously underestimated contributions from pollinating insects to both the yield and the market value of oilseed rape.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim: Alterations to the abundance and distribution of plants, especially shrubs, have been predicted by warming experiments and confirmed by remote-sensing analyses and land-based observations in the Low Arctic. In the High Arctic, analyses of satellite images suggest a recent increase in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and warming experiments have shown a positive correlation between temperature and shrub cover, but little is known about the responses of natural systems. In this context, we investigated populations of Arctic willow (Salix arctica Pall.) to assess the potential contribution of this structuring species to High Arctic shrubification.
Location: Seven polar semidesert sites, including two glacier forelands, in High Arctic Canada and Greenland.
Methods: We evaluated the size distribution and establishment age of Arctic willow populations through field measurements and dendrochronological analysis. We also assessed the cover of Arctic willow at each site and compared current data with historical records.
Results: Age determination of over 200 large individuals established by seed suggests that colonization events were associated with the melting of permanent snow and glacial ice. Size distributions showed that recent recruitment was more frequent on glacier forelands, even though seedling establishment was common in other sites. Comparing our measurements with previous studies at the same sites revealed that significant increases in cover over the past few decades occurred only on glacier forelands.
Main conclusions: Our results suggest that the population structure and dynamics of Arctic willow in the High Arctic are influenced by site-specific factors. Rapid glacier retreat is increasing the extent of the glacier forelands, which are currently experiencing relatively rapid plant colonization. Some sheltered sites with greater snow accumulation will probably experience increased shrub colonization under current and predicted climate change. It appears, however, that shrub recruitment and growth are still strongly limited by water availability, and the reduction in permanent snow cover may exacerbate this stress.},

  abstract  = {New canola cultivars have much higher yield potential than conventional canola cultivars and changes in production practices may be needed to achieve optimum yield from these cultivars. Studies were conducted to investigate the influence of seeding rates (2.8, 5.6 and 8.4 kg ha-1), fertilizer level (67% – low, 100% – medium, 133% – high of the commercial recommendation) and fungicide application on growth, dry matter accumulation, seed yield and seed quality using two high-yielding canola cultivars [cv. Quantum, open pollinated (OP), and cv. Invigor™, hybrid (HYB)]. The studies were conducted from 1999 to 2001 at three sites in the Parkland region of the Canadian prairies. The two cultivars did not differ in their responses to seeding and fertilizer rates, or fungicide application. Plant density was lower for the HYB than the OP because the HYB had larger seeds, with fewer seeds per kilogram. Emergence declined slightly at high fertilizer levels in some site-years due to fertilizer induced seedling damage, but increased with seeding rate. Time to onset of flowering and maturity showed no consistent influence of cultivar, and tended to be somewhat prolonged with an increase in fertilizer levels, but reduced by an increase in seeding rate. On average, the HYB produced 822 kg ha-1 more biomass and 200 kg ha-1 more seed yield than the OP. Sclerotinia stem rot incidence was very low, except at Melfort in 2000, and fungicide application generally failed to benefit the crop. Seed yield was generally increased when seeding rate was increased, with the largest increase occurring from 2.8 to 5.8 kg ha-1. Seed yield responses to the high rates of seeding or fertilizer only occurred where both inputs were at the highest level, indicating that the optimum level of one was dependent upon the level of the other input. Oil and protein concentration in the seed was higher for the HYB than the OP. High fertilizer levels generally increased the total yield of biomass and seed, and protein concentration in the seed, but usually reduced oil concentration in the seed. Increased seeding rate resulted in a small increase in oil concentration and a small reduction in protein concentration in the seed. Net returns were greatest and least variable for the HYB cultivar. Overall, the HYB performed better than the OP, and the full economic value of high-yielding canola cultivars was only realized when fertilizer and seeding rates were at or above the current recommended rates},

Although many species are known to provide pollination services, honeybees (Apis mellifera) are often assumed to provide the majority of these services to agriculture. Using data from a range of secondary sources, this study assesses the importance of insect pollinated crops at regional and national scales and investigates the capacity of honeybees to provide optimal pollination services to \{UK\} agriculture. The findings indicate that insect pollinated crops have become increasingly important in \{UK\} crop agriculture and, as of 2007, accounted for 20% of \{UK\} cropland and 19% of total farmgate crop value. Analysis of honeybee hive numbers indicates that current \{UK\} populations are only capable of supplying 34% of pollination service demands even under favourable assumptions, falling from 70% in 1984. In spite of this decline, insect pollinated crop yields have risen by an average of 54% since 1984, casting doubt on long held beliefs that honeybees provide the majority of pollination services. Future land use and crop production patterns may further increase the role of pollination services to \{UK\} agriculture, highlighting the importance of measures aimed at maintaining both wild and managed species.},

Across a variety of sites, NPP was significantly related to precipitation (r2 = 0.37), but much variability was unexplained. Thus, we evaluated the relationship between NPP with meteorological variables and soil moisture measurements in tallgrass prairie sites that varied in fire frequency and topographic position. Annually burned lowland sites had significantly higher NPP than either annually burned upland or unburned sites. NPP in burned sites was more strongly related to meteorological variables and soil moisture when compared to unburned sites. The lack of significant correlation between soil moisture with NPP on unburned sites suggests that factors other than water availability limit production in these sites. When NPP data were analyzed separately by life forms, interannual variability in forb NPP was not correlated with any meteorological variables, but was negatively correlated with grass NPP (r = -0.49). The inability of a single factor, such as precipitation to explain a large portion of the interannual variability in NPP is consistent with the concept that patterns of NPP in tallgrass prairie are a product of spatial and temporal variability in light, water, and nutrients, driven by a combination of topography, fire history, and climate.},

present, they showed spatial complementarity to honey bees and visited the bottom tree sections more frequently. As
wind speed increased, honey bees’ spatial preference shifted toward the bottom tree sections. In high winds
(>2.5 m s+/-1), orchards with low pollinator diversity (honey bees only) received almost no flower visits. In orchards
with high pollinator diversity, visitation decreased to a lesser extent as wild bee visitation was unaffected by high
winds. Our results demonstrate how spatial complementarity in diverse communities can help buffer pollination
services to environmental changes like wind speed.},

  abstract  = {In diverse pollinator communities, interspecific interactions may modify the behaviour and increase the pollination effectiveness of individual species. Because agricultural production reliant on pollination is growing, improving pollination effectiveness could increase crop yield without any increase in agricultural intensity or area. In California almond, a crop highly dependent on honey bee pollination, we explored the foraging behaviour and pollination effectiveness of honey bees in orchards with simple (honey bee only) and diverse (non-Apis bees present) bee communities. In orchards with non-Apis bees, the foraging behaviour of honey bees changed and the pollination effectiveness of a single honey bee visit was greater than in orchards where non-Apis bees were absent. This change translated to a greater proportion of fruit set in these orchards. Our field experiments show that increased pollinator diversity can synergistically increase pollination service, through species interactions that alter the behaviour and resulting functional quality of a dominant pollinator species. These results of functional synergy between species were supported by an additional controlled cage experiment with Osmia lignaria and Apis mellifera. Our findings highlight a largely unexplored facilitative component of the benefit of biodiversity to ecosystem services, and represent a way to improve pollinator-dependent crop yields in a sustainable manner.},

  abstract  = {Despite scientific and media attention on pollinator declines, there is still only a rudimentary understanding of the response of bees - the most important group of pollinators worldwide - to ongoing land use changes. Euglossine bees are an ecologically important Neotropical clade of forest-dependent pollinators. Despite the fact that euglossines are well studied relative to other groups of tropical bees, only three previous studies, all from Brazil, address the response of euglossines to forest fragmentation. In this study, I tripled the maximum sample size of previous efforts by sampling male euglossines in 22 forest fragments ranging in area from 0.25 ha to 230 ha in southern Costa Rica, using chemically baited Van Someren traps. Abundance of euglossine bees was significantly positively related to forest fragment size, negatively related to shape (edge:area ratio), and marginally related to fragment isolation. Euglossine species richness showed similar, but weaker trends: richness was significantly positively related to the quantity of forest edge, marginally negatively related to fragment area, and not related to fragment isolation. The positive relationship between euglossine richness and abundance and forest fragment edge is consistent with other studies that have found high euglossine density in secondary or disturbed forest. The data suggest that individual euglossines move between forest fragments, as has been shown in other systems. Still, forest fragmentation appears to affect euglossine bees more strongly than other bee groups in the study region. Their large flight range and positive relationship with forest edges may help to buffer the negative effects of fragmentation, allowing euglossines to utilize even the very smallest forest fragments in the study area.},

We investigate optimal farm design for agricultural pollination services from bees nesting in native habitat, integrating ecological and economic approaches in a spatial modeling framework. We evaluate the simplest case, and then add consideration of bee metapopulation dynamics and heterogeneity in farmland productivity. We find that the need for spatially even pollination coverage across farms means that bee habitat is often denser at the edges, rather than the centers, of optimally designed farms, and also highly constrains the ability of farmers to site bee habitat in less-productive areas of farms with spatial gradients in agricultural fertility. Optimal farm configuration is not purely a matter of uniform size and spacing of bee habitat: in some circumstances, farms combine large parcels—to ensure bee population persistence—with smaller, dispersed patches to provide spatially continuous pollination services. The highest-yield farm designs are those with a relatively small (but non-zero) area of pollination reservoirs, suggesting a conservation strategy of small parcels of service-providing habitat interspersed throughout working landscapes. The design principles outlined here are likely general and applicable to other ecosystem services supplied at local scales, such as agricultural pest control.},

  abstract  = {1.Increased incidence of landscape fire, and pollinator declines with co-extinctions of dependent plant species, are both globally significant. Fire can alter species distributions, but its effects on plant-pollinator interactions are poorly understood so its present and future role in coupled plant-pollinator declines cannot be assessed.2.We develop a conceptual model of fire effects on plant-pollinator interactions. We review the empirical literature in the context of this model to identify important knowledge gaps regarding the processes underlying these effects and the phenotypic traits of flowering plants and pollinators mediating these effects. Fire generates, and plant-pollinator interactions respond to, heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales. There is evidence of local-scale fire effects on these interactions, but landscape-scale effects are poorly understood. Nest location and floral resource utilization primarily mediate pollinator survival during and after fire. Voltinism and mobility traits are potentially important but poorly studied. Plant traits mediating flowering responses to fire include growth form, phenology, and potentially bud location, seasonal changes in bud exposure, and response to bud damage.3.Synthesis and applications. We suggest management actions and an agenda for future research to fill knowledge gaps currently inhibiting predictions of fire effects on plant-pollinator interactions. Fire regimes promoting floral diversity at local scales provide a surrogate means of managing pollinators and pollination while empirical research continues. Above-ground nesting, univoltine pollinators may be particularly vulnerable under expected fire regime changes. Improved knowledge of traits mediating exploitation of landscape heterogeneity could be used to enhance persistence of these species. Ultimately, our conceptual framework could be used as a basis for understanding fire effects on aggregate network properties to inform fire management strategies buffering plant-pollinator networks against secondary species extinctions.This article is protected by copyright.

This paper focused attention on problems of species diversity and community organization that have occupied many theoretical and empirical ecologists for the last two decades. In the present paper I evaluate the attempt to answer Hutchinson's question by considering three topics. First, I reexamine the main themes which Hutchinson developed in “The Homage” and call attention to the central importance of energetic relationships in his view of ecological communities. Second, I examine the development of theoretical community ecology over the last two decades in an attempt to determine why some avenues of investigation, such as competition theory, have proven disappointing, whereas others, such as the theory of island biogeography, have enjoyed at least modest success. Finally, I suggest that future attempts to understand patterns of species diversity might focus on developing two kinds of theoretical constructs: capacity rules, which describe how characteristics of the physical environment determine its capacity to support life, and allocation rules, which describe how limited energetic resources are subdivided among species.},

The timing af annual cycles and the pattern of inter-annual fluctuations also differed among species. However, two results suggest that several species responded similarly to long-term environmental variation: 1) population densities of four species and total rodent biomass and numbers were positively correlated with the densities of annual plants; and 2) many pairs of species exhibited positively correlated population dynamics over the ten years. Clustering of pairwise cross-correlation coefficients was used to identify sets of species with similar population dynamics. These clusters did not necessarily contain closely related or ecologically similar species. Detrended Correspondence Analysis identified three independent patterns of variation in species composition: a long-term trend; a four- to five-year repeated pattern that appeared to correspond to the climatic effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation; and an annual cycle. In general, species appeared to respond individualistically to environmental variation. There was no evidence of an equilibrium community composition or of alternative stable configurations. Some competing species had negatively correlated population dynamics, but the majority of competitors exhibited positive correlations that apparently reflected similar responses to fluctuating resources.},

  abstract  = {Among colonies of social insects, the worker turnover rate (colony ``pace") typically shows considerable variation. This has epidemiological consequences for parasites, because in ``fast-paced" colonies, with short-lived workers, the time of parasite residence in a given host will be reduced, and further transmission may thus get less likely. Here, we test this idea and ask whether pace is a life-history strategy against infectious parasites. We infected bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) with the infectious gut parasite Crithidia bombi, and experimentally manipulated birth and death rates to mimic slow and fast pace. We found that fewer workers and, importantly, fewer last-generation workers that are responsible for rearing sexuals were infected in colonies with faster pace. This translates into increased fitness in fast-paced colonies, as daughter queens exposed to fewer infected workers in the nest are less likely to become infected themselves, and have a higher chance of founding their own colonies in the next year. High worker turnover rate can thus act as a strategy of defence against a spreading infection in social insect colonies.},

  abstract  = {Background and Aims Evolution of autonomous selfing may be advantageous because it allows for reproductive assurance. In co-flowering plants competing for pollinators, the least common and/or attractive could suffer pollen limitations. Silene niceensis and S. ramosissima are taxonomically related species sharing the same habitat, although S. ramosissima is less abundant and has a more restricted distribution. They also have the same a priori nocturnal pollinator syndrome, and show an overlapping flowering phenology. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a selfing strategy in S. ramosissima allows it to avoid pollinator competition and/or interspecific pollen transfer with S. niceensis, which would thus enable both species to reach high levels of fruit and seed set.Methods The breeding system, petal colour, flower life span and degree of overlap between male and female phases, floral visitor abundance and visitation rates were analysed in two sympatric populations of S. niceensis and S. ramosissima in southern Spain.Key Results Autonomous selfing in S. ramosissima produced very high fruit and seed set, which was also similar to open-pollinated plants. Silene niceensis showed minimum levels of autonomous selfing, and pollen/ovule ratios were within the range expected for the breeding system. In contrast to S. niceensis, flower life span was much shorter in S. ramosissima, and male and female organs completely overlapped in space and time. Upper surface petals of both species showed differing brightness, chroma and hue. Flowers of S. niceensis were actively visited by moths, hawkmoths and syrphids, whereas those of S. ramosissima were almost never visited.Conclusions The findings show that different breeding strategies exist between the sympatric co-flowering S. niceensis and S. ramosissima, the former specializing in crepuscular-nocturnal pollination and the latter mainly based on autonomous selfing. These two strategies allow both species to share the restricted dune habitat in which they exist, with a high female reproductive success due to the absence of pollinator competition and/or interspecific pollen flow.},

(Boraginaceae), Centaurea cyanus L. (Asteraceae) and Brassica napus L. (Brassicaceae). We quantified the foraging behaviour and brood cell production by mother bees, and compared the quality of offspring in pure and mixed flower species stands. Offspring survival in pure stands was expected to reflect the mothers’ foraging preferences in the mixed stand. Pure stands of B. napus supported highest offspring survival, body mass and fraction of females produced. Offspring survival on C. cyanus and B. officinalis was very low. Larval mortality occurred earlier in brood cells provided with B. officinalis pollen than in brood cells provided with C. cyanus pollen suggesting different effects of pollen quality on early larval and later development. The time spent on different foraging activities correlated with lifetime reproductive output. However, in mixed stands, the proportion of time the bees were foraging on the different flower species did not differ significantly. Foraging behaviour may therefore not generally be a good proxy for the quality of floral resources for offspring production. Our results suggest that resources collected from one plant species may influence the usefulness of resources from another plant species. Bees may therefore overcome potentially deleterious effects of the suboptimal resources by mixing low- and high-quality resources. This may help generalist bees, such as O. bicornis, to cope with an unpredictable environment.},

  abstract  = {A central topic for conservation science is evaluating how human activities influence global species diversity. Humanity exacerbates extinction rates. But by what mechanisms does humanity drive the emergence of new species? We review human-mediated speciation, compare speciation and known extinctions, and discuss the challenges of using net species diversity as a conservation objective. Humans drive rapid evolution through relocation, domestication, hunting and novel ecosystem creation{\textemdash}and emerging technologies could eventually provide additional mechanisms. The number of species relocated, domesticated and hunted during the Holocene is of comparable magnitude to the number of observed extinctions. While instances of human-mediated speciation are known, the overall effect these mechanisms have upon speciation rates has not yet been quantified. We also explore the importance of anthropogenic influence upon divergence in microorganisms. Even if human activities resulted in no net loss of species diversity by balancing speciation and extinction rates, this would probably be deemed unacceptable. We discuss why, based upon {\textquoteleft}no net loss{\textquoteright} conservation literature{\textemdash}considering phylogenetic diversity and other metrics, risk aversion, taboo trade-offs and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that evaluating speciation alongside extinction could result in more nuanced understanding of biosphere trends, clarifying what it is we actually value about biodiversity.},

  abstract            = {Bateman's principle states that male fitness is usually limited by the number of matings achieved, while female fitness is usually limited by the resources available for reproduction. When applied to flowering plants this principle leads to the expectation that pollen limitation of fruit and seed set will be uncommon. However, if male searching for mates (including pollen dissemination via external agents) is not sufficiently successful, then the reproductive success of both sexes (or both sex functions in hermaphroditic plants) will be limited by number of matings rather than by resources, and Bateman's principle cannot be expected to apply. Limitation of female success due to inadequate pollen receipt appears to be a common phenomenon in plants. Using published data on 258 species in which fecundity was reported for natural pollination and hand pollination with outcross pollen, I found significant pollen limitation at some times or in some sites in 159 of the 258 species (62%). When experiments were performed multiple times within a growing season, or in multiple sites or years, the statistical significance of pollen limitation commonly varied among times, sites or years, indicating that the pollination environment is not constant. There is some indication that, across species, supplemental pollen leads to increased fruit set more often than increased seed set within fruits, pointing to the importance of gamete packaging strategies in plant reproduction. Species that are highly self-incompatible obtain a greater benefit relative to natural pollination from artificial application of excess outcross pollen than do self-compatible species. This suggests that inadequate pollen receipt is a primary cause of low fecundity rates in perennial plants, which are often self-incompatible. Because flowering plants often allocate considerable resources to pollinator attraction, both export and receipt of pollen could be limited primarily by resource investment in floral advertisement and rewards. But whatever investment is made is attraction, pollinator behavioral stochasticity usually produces wide variation among flowers in reproductive success through both male and female functions. In such circumstances the optimal deployment of resources among megaspores, microspores, and pollinator attraction may often require more flowers or more ovules per flower than will usually be fertilized, in order to benefit from chance fluctuations that bring in large number of pollen grains. Maximizing seed set for the entire plant in a stochastic pollination environment might thus entail a packaging strategy for flower number or ovule number per flower that makes pollen limitation of fruit or seed set likely. Pollen availability may limit female success in individual flowers, entire plants (in a season or over a lifetime), or populations. The appropriate level must be distinguished depending on the nature of the question being addressed.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: Colonies of Atta cephalotes (Myrmicinae: Formicidae) construct cleared paths between their nest and the vegetation sources at which they harvest leaf tissue. Here, we employ ideas from traffic engineering to study streams of laden and unladen ants on these paths. The relationship between average traffic speed and the concentration of workers on the road surface follows a relationship similar to what is expected by analogy to fluid dynamics. Although the traffic is composed of eusocial organisms with a common interest in group success, the coarse-grained behavior of Atta traffic displays little more coordination than a moving fluid. The relationship between speed and concentration implies that maximum flow rates (which are likely to be closely tied to colony-level rates of resource acquisition) occur at a relatively high concentration that keeps individual speeds well below their “free flow” maximum. We predict that this optimal concentration will characterize peak traffic throughout a trail network, and we propose a simple behavioral mechanism that would allow trails to be cleared to the correct width to provide the optimal concentration. Collisions (including encounters for antennation) are common in leaf-cutting ant traffic because traffic is not segregated into unidirectional streams. Nonetheless, we find a counterintuitive suggestion that flow rates (with concentration differences statistically removed) are higher when traffic is near a 50:50 mix of outbound and returning ants than when it contains majority flows in a single direction. Mixed-direction traffic may help disperse laden ants with reduced agility, thereby preventing inhomogeneities in the traffic stream that could clog the trail.},

  Abstract                 = {1) Competition between the alleles bw75 and bw in population cages gave no evidence of a trend in gene frequency change in any of seven cages during the period of observation, although the mean frequency over all cages at the time of the first sampling was significantly below 0.50, the frequency in the foundation flies. 2) Experiments designed to ascertain the relative viabilities and productivities of the several genotypes (bw75/bw75, bw75/ bw & bw/bw), male and female, showed significant departures from the expected segregation ratios in 3 of 21 population types. These differences could not be systematically interpreted and were not reproduced in a subsidiary study. 3) Study was made of the changes in the frequency of bw75 between generations in cultures perpetuated for 19 generations with random samples of 16 individuals. The sample size was sufficiently small to permit considerable random drift. Two series of about 100 cultures each were set up at an initial frequency of 0.50. Series I was conducted in 35 cc. homeopathic vials, series II in 60 cc. specimen jars. The total gene frequency in series I did not change systematically during the course of the experiment. In series II the gene frequency rose for four generations after which no consistent changes occurred. 4) The fixation rate after generation 11 in series I was not significantly different from uniformity by chi-square. Series II was not carried for a number of generations sufficient to permit a satisfactory estimate of fixation rate. 5) No evidence consistent with an hypothesis of selection appeared in either series when the sample frequencies were grouped according to donor frequency classes. From this standpoint gene frequency changes could safely be attributed wholly to accidents of sampling. 6) The distribution of gene frequency by generation among the bottles of series I and II approached stability of form in generations 11 and 17 respectively. The grouped frequency distribution over the last 9 generations in series I was in poor accord with an hypothesis of uniformity, based on the apparent absence of selection, showing both an excessive irregularity and a negative slope of probable significance. The grouped distribution over the last 3 generations of series II was in good accord with the expected uniformity. 7) Estimates of the average effective population size made from the observed recipient class variances gave values of Ne equal to 9.0 and 11.5 for series I and II respectively, 56% and 72% of the sample size of 16 individuals. 8) A highly significant regression of 1/2Ne on donor class frequency was observed in series I indicating higher variances at higher frequencies than could be accounted for on the assumption of a common estimate of effective population size. This effect explains the slope of the frequency distributions of series I after stability of form was approximated. The theoretical distribution on the assumption of the observed regression is in agreement with respect to general slope but indicates that stability of form had not been fully reached as early as preliminary considerations suggested. The lack of accord between the observed and theoretical distri butions of series I is discussed from several standpoints, 9) The observed fixation rate in series I was higher than expected assuming an effective population size of 9.0 but the difference was not significant. 10) Curves representing the expected increase in the total variance of gene frequency and decrease in the percentage heterozygosis over the period of observation were calculated for each series using the mean estimates of effective population size based upon observed recipient class variances. The agreement between the observed rates and rates indicated by the calculated curves was good in the case of series II but showed some inconsistency in series I. 11) The differences between series I and II with respect to effective population size estimates, dependence of 1/2Ne on q, agreement with expectation of the form of the distribution with expectation of the form of the distribution of gene frequencies after stability had been approached, the homogeneity of the observed recipient class variances, rates of increase in total variance and decrease in heterozygosis are related to the size of the culture container. The data of series I are more heterogeneous in all respects.},

  abstract  = {Over the years, the evolutionary importance of natural hybridization has been a contentious issue. At one extreme is the relatively common view of hybridization as an evolutionarily unimportant process. A less common perspective, but one that has gained support over the past decade, is that of hybridization as a relatively widespread and potentially creative evolutionary process. Indeed, studies documenting the production of hybrid genotypes exhibiting a wide range of fitnesses have become increasingly common. In this review, we examine the genetic basis of such variation in hybrid fitness. In particular, we assess the genetic architecture of hybrid inferiority (both sterility and inviability). We then extend our discussion to the genetic basis of increased fitness in certain hybrid genotypes. The available evidence argues that hybrid inferiority is the result of widespread negative epistasis in a hybrid genetic background. In contrast, increased hybrid fitness can be most readily explained through the segregation of additive genetic factors, with epistasis playing a more limited role.},

Although techniques to analyze plant-pollinator networks began to emerge a decade ago, the characterization of spatiotemporal variation of interactions is still in its infancy. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences of spatial and temporal variation in plant-pollinator interactions is important for both basic and applied questions in community structure and function, the evolution of floral traits, and the development of optimal conservation strategies. Here we review observational, theoretical, and experimental studies of temporal and spatial variation in plant-pollinator interaction networks to establish a foundation for future studies to incorporate perspectives in spatiotemporal variation. Such perspectives are crucial given the rapid environmental changes associated with habitat loss, climate change, and biological invasions, which we discuss in this context. The inherent plasticity of plant-pollinator interactions and network structure suggests that many species should be able to persist by responding to environmental changes quickly, even though the identity of their mutualistic partners may change.},

  abstract  = {The availability of soil and pollination resources are main determinants of fitness in many flowering plants, but the degree to which each is limiting and how they interact to affect plant fitness is unknown for many species. We performed resource (water and nutrients) and pollination (open and supplemental) treatments on two species of flowering plants, Ipomopsis aggregata and Linum lewisii, that differed in life-history, and we measured how resource addition affected floral characters, pollination, and reproduction (both male and female function). We separated the direct effects of resources versus indirect effects on female function via changes in pollination using a factorial experiment and path analysis. Resource addition affected I. aggregata and L. lewisii differently. Ipomopsis aggregata, a monocarp, responded to fertilization in the year of treatment application, increasing flower production, bloom duration, corolla width, nectar production, aboveground biomass, and pollen receipt relative to control plants. Fertilization also increased total seed production per plant, and hand-pollination increased seeds per fruit in I. aggregata, indicating some degree of pollen limitation of seed production. In contrast, fertilization had no effect on growth or reproductive output in the year of treatment on L. lewisii, a perennial, except that fertilization lengthened bloom duration. However, delayed effects of fertilization were seen in the year following treatment, with fertilized plants having greater aboveground biomass, seeds per fruit, and seeds per plant than control plants. In both species, there were no effects of resource addition on male function, and the direct effects of fertilization on female function were relatively stronger than the indirect effects via changes in pollination. Although we studied only two plant species, our results suggest that life-history traits may play an important role in determining the reproductive responses of plants to soil nutrient and pollen additions.},

- They claim that there's a phenological mismatch, but in reality, the "mismatch" is just 2.5 days. Seems miniscule to me, considering the sample size.
- Claim that most of the reduction in diversity is due to loss in forest habitat, but spend at most 1/2 a sentence discussing this. Perhaps this wasn't really their main focus, but if not, they basically just leave it up to us to figure out when/how the network was messed up.
- Time scale is confusing (due to the format of Science articles). They jump from sampling done in the late 1800s to sampling done in 2009/2010, but then randomly have some data from 1970s. Where did this come from?},

to global change has global implications. Most tundra
regions lack sustained environmental monitoring and one
of the only ways to document multi-decadal change is to
resample historic research sites. The International Polar
Year (IPY) provided a unique opportunity for such research
through the Back to the Future (BTF) project (IPY project
#512). This article synthesizes the results from 13 papers
within this Ambio Special Issue. Abiotic changes include
glacial recession in the Altai Mountains, Russia; increased
snow depth and hardness, permafrost warming, and
increased growing season length in sub-arctic Sweden;
drying of ponds in Greenland; increased nutrient availability
in Alaskan tundra ponds, and warming at most
locations studied. Biotic changes ranged from relatively
minor plant community change at two sites in Greenland to
moderate change in the Yukon, and to dramatic increases
in shrub and tree density on Herschel Island, and in subarctic
Sweden. The population of geese tripled at one site
in northeast Greenland where biomass in non-grazed plots
doubled. A model parameterized using results from a BTF
study forecasts substantial declines in all snowbeds and
increases in shrub tundra on Niwot Ridge, Colorado over
the next century. In general, results support and provide
improved capacities for validating experimental manipulation,
remote sensing, and modeling studies.},

Fragmentary observations, however, have suggested population declines in several North American species. Despite rising concern over these observations in the United States, highlighted in a recent National Academy of Sciences report, a national assessment of the geographic scope and possible causal factors of bumble bee decline is lacking. Here, we report results of a 3-y interdisciplinary study of changing distributions, population genetic structure, and levels of pathogen infection in bumble bee populations across the United States. We compare current and historical distributions of eight species, compiling a database of >73,000 museum records for comparison with data from intensive nationwide surveys of >16,000 specimens. We show that the relative abundances of four species have declined by up to 96% and that their surveyed geographic ranges have contracted by 23–87%, some within the last 20 y. We also show that declining populations have significantly higher infection levels of the microsporidian pathogen Nosema bombi and lower genetic diversity compared with co-occurring populations of the stable (nondeclining) species. Higher pathogen prevalence and reduced genetic diversity are, thus, realistic predictors of these alarming patterns of decline in North America, although cause and effect remain uncertain.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Flower strips are widely recommended as a tool to boost insect pollinators and yield in pollinator-dependent crops. Using \{UK\} cider apple orchards (Malus domestica Borkhausen) as a model system, we assessed whether flower strips increased pollination services in orchards. Pollinator communities (visual observation) and pollination services (fruit set) were assessed at increasing distance from surrounding semi-natural habitats (0–200 m) in eight orchards. In four orchards, perennial flower strips had been established and bloomed in the year before the main experiment. In a separate experiment, insect visits to apple flowers were observed to investigate possible functional mechanisms underpinning pollinator efficacy. The visit rate of wild insects to apple flowers (non-Apis bees and flies), but not that of honeybees (Apis mellifera L.), increased by 40% in flower strip orchards compared to control orchards, particularly in areas close to semi-natural habitat (&lt;100 m). Wild insect visitation was also positively related to dandelion (Taraxacum species) abundance in orchards. Fruit set in orchards was positively related to wild insect richness, and andrenid bee (Andrena species) visitation, but neither richness nor andrenid bee visit rate responded positively to flower strips. Wild bees (andrenid bees and bumblebees (Bombus species)) contacted apple stigma (95 and 100% of visits) more often than honeybees (81%), but only bumblebees moved frequently between different tree rows, an important trait for transfer of compatible pollen in apples. Our results demonstrate that flower strips enhanced overall wild insect abundance but not pollination services in cider orchards. Positive effects of ground flora on wild insect abundance in orchards suggest that flower mixtures or orchard management could be optimised for andrenid bees, the single most important pollinator taxa, by increasing the availability of early-flowering plants in orchards. Equally, wild insect richness was highest in areas close to semi-natural habitats. Therefore, whilst flower strips can boost abundance of the existing species pool, only large scale preservation of (semi-) natural habitat will maintain pollinator diversity in apple orchards.},

Our design cross two factors, pollen level (hand-pollinated or control) and resource level (water added, water and fertilizer added, or control). Both hand-pollination and fertilizing during the blooming season increased total seed production, while watering alone has no effect on any component of reproductive success. Hand-pollination boosted number of seeds per flower, with no effect on flower number. In contrasts, fertilizing had its primary effect on the number of flowers produced, while also increasing the number of seeds per mature fruit in hand-pollinated plants. Fertilizing increased nectar volume, but path analysis detected no indirect effect of this increased reward rate on seed production, suggesting instead that fertilizing has a slight, but direct, effect on seeds per flower. These results argue against a strict dichotomy between pollen limitation and resource limitation of female reproductive success in plants.},

  Abstract                 = {Models of hybrid zones differ in their assumptions about the relative fitnesses of hybrids and the parental species. These fitness relationships determine the form of selection across the hybrid zone and, along with gene flow, the evolutionary dynamics and eventual outcome of natural hybridization. We measured a component of fitness, export and receipt of pollen in single pollinator visits, for hybrids between the herbaceous plants Ipomopsis aggregata and I. tenuituba and for both parental species. In aviary experiments with captive hummingbirds, hybrid flowers outperformed flowers of both parental species by receiving more pollen on the stigma. Although hummingbirds were more effective at removing pollen from anthers of I. aggregata, hybrid flowers matched both parental species in the amount of pollen exported to stigmas of other flowers. These patterns of pollen transfer led to phenotypic stabilizing selection, during that stage of the life cycle, for a stigma position intermediate between that of the two species and to directional selection for exserted anthers. Pollen transfer between the species was high, with flowers of I. aggregata exporting pollen equally successfully to conspecific and I. tenuituba flowers. Although this study showed that natural hybrids enjoy the highest quality of pollinator visits, a previous study found that I. aggregata receives the highest quantity of pollinator visits. Thus, the relative fitness of hybrids changes over the life cycle. By combining the results of both studies, pollinator-mediated selection in this hybrid zone is predicted to be strong and directional, with hybrid fitness intermediate between that of the parental species.},

  abstract  = {Few studies directly address the consequences of habitat fragmentation for communities of pollinating insects, particularly for the key pollinator group, bees (Hymenoptera: Apiformes). Bees typically live in habitats where nesting substrates and bloom are patchily distributed and spatially dissociated. Bee studies have all defined habitat fragments as remnant patches of floral hosts or forests, overlooking the nesting needs of bees. Several authors conclude that habitat fragmentation is broadly deleterious, but their own data show that some native species proliferate in sampled fragments. Other studies report greater densities and comparable diversities of native bees at flowers in some fragment size classes relative to undisrupted habitats, but find dramatic shifts in species composition. Insightful studies of habitat fragmentation and bees will consider fragmentation, alteration, and loss of nesting habitats, not just patches of forage plants, as well as the permeability of the surrounding matrix to interpatch movement. Inasmuch as the floral associations and nesting habits of bees are often attributes of species or subgenera, ecological interpretations hinge on authoritative identifications. Study designs must accommodate statistical problems associated with bee community samples, especially non-normal data and frequent zero values. The spatial scale of fragmentation must be appreciated: bees of medium body size can regularly fly 1–2 km from nest site to forage patch. Overall, evidence for prolonged persistence of substantial diversity and abundances of native bee communities in habitat fragments of modest size promises practical solutions for maintaining bee populations. Provided that reserve selection, design, and management can address the foraging and nesting needs of bees, networks of even small reserves may hold hope for sustaining considerable pollinator diversity and the ecological services pollinators provide.},

This approach has advanced our understanding of communities, but it obscures the timescale at which interactions form (or dissolve) and the drivers and consequences of such dynamics. We address this knowledge gap by quantifying the within-season turnover of plant-pollinator interactions from weekly censuses across 3 years in a subalpine ecosystem. Week-to-week turnover of interactions (1) was high, (2) followed a consistent seasonal progression in all years of study and (3) was dominated by interaction rewiring (the reassembly of interactions among species). Simulation models revealed that species’ phenologies and relative abundances constrained both total interaction turnover and rewiring. Our findings reveal the diversity of species interactions that may be missed when the temporal dynamics of networks are ignored.},

Divergence times have been estimated for a few groups of bees, but no study has yet provided estimates for all major bee lineages. To date the origin of bees and their major clades, we first perform a phylogenetic analysis of bees including representatives from every extant family, subfamily and almost all tribes, using sequence data from seven genes. We then use this phylogeny to place 14 time calibration points based on information from the fossil record for an uncorrelated relaxed clock divergence time analysis taking into account uncertainties in phylogenetic relationships and the fossil record. We explore the effect of placing a hard upper age bound near the root of the tree and the effect of different topologies on our divergence time estimates. We estimate that crown bees originated approximately 123 Ma (million years ago) (113{\textendash}132 Ma), concurrently with the origin or diversification of the eudicots, a group comprising 75 per cent of angiosperm species. All of the major bee clades are estimated to have originated during the Middle to Late Cretaceous, which is when angiosperms became the dominant group of land plants.},

Here we use a model-based approach to reconstruct the evolutionary history of eusociality and date the antiquity of eusocial behavior in apid bees, using a recent molecular phylogeny of the Apidae. We conclude that eusociality evolved once in the common ancestor of the corbiculate Apidae, advanced eusociality evolved independently in the honey and stingless bees, and that eusociality was lost in the orchid bees. Fossil-calibrated divergence time estimates reveal that eusociality first evolved at least 87 Mya (78 to 95 Mya) in the corbiculates, much earlier than in other groups of bees with less complex social behavior. These results provide a robust new evolutionary framework for studies of the organization and genetic basis of social behavior in honey bees and their relatives.},

  abstract  = {The idea that productivity regulates species diversity is deeply ingrained in the field of ecology. Yet, over the past few decades, an increasing number of experiments have shown that species diversity controls, rather than simply responds to, biomass production. These contrasting perspectives have led to a seeming paradox: Is diversity the cause or the consequence of biological production? Here we present empirical evidence for the multivariate productivity-diversity (MPD) hypothesis, which argues that differing perspectives on productivity-diversity relationships can be resolved by recognizing that historical research has focused on how resource supply regulates both the productivity and richness of local competitors, whereas more recent studies have focused on how the richness of a colonist pool regulates the efficiency by which resources are captured and converted into new tissue. The MPD hypothesis predicts that three pathways operate concurrently to generate productivity-diversity relationships in nature: (1) resource supply directly limits the standing biomass and/or rate of new production by primary producers, (2) producer biomass is directly influenced by the richness of species that locally compete for resources, and (3) resource supply rate indirectly affects producer biomass by influencing the fraction of species from a colonist pool that locally coexist. To examine whether this set of pathways explains covariation between productivity and diversity in natural streams, we used nutrient-diffusing agar “patches” to manipulate resource supply rates in 20 streams throughout the Sierra Nevada mountain range, California, USA. We then measured the fraction of periphyton species from the stream colonist pool co-occurring on each nutrient patch, as well as the standing biomass and rates of primary production. Natural patterns of covariation agreed with predictions of the MPD hypothesis. Algal biomass was an increasing function of nutrient supply, and an increasing function of local richness. The fraction of species from the colonist pool found co-occurring on a patch was a concave-down function of nutrient supply, causing nutrients to indirectly affect biomass via control over local richness. These results suggest that the MPD hypothesis is a viable explanation of patterns of diversity and productivity in natural stream ecosystems, and that it has potential to merge the historical view that productivity drives diversity with a parallel view that diversity drives productivity.},

The optimal-foraging model is based on the marginal value theorem (MVT). The robust-satisficing model developed here is an application of info-gap decision theory. The info-gap robust-satisficing model relates to the same circumstances described by the MVT. We show how these two alternatives translate into specific predictions that at some points are quite disparate. We test these alternative predictions against available data collected in numerous field studies with a large number of species from diverse taxonomic groups.

  abstract  = {The agricultural production of canola in the Canadian prairies is expanding rapidly, with expected yields of 16 million tonnes per year by the year 2025. It will therefore become increasingly important to better understand the relationship between wild pollinators and semi pollinator-dependent crops like canola (Brassica napus). The ecosystems services that wild insects supply could potentially be disrupted by intensive agricultural land use. Biologically diverse landscapes are necessary to uphold insect guided pollination. The loss or dissociation of food or nesting opportunities connected to these landscapes is one of the main causal factors behind a recent decrease in wild pollinators. Most studies which connect canola yields and pollination services involve experimental designs which have input managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) into the agricultural system. To expand this body of knowledge, this study investigates whether wild insects play a role in seed setting in Canadian canola under real world agricultural production. We tested whether variance in seed set is attributable to parameters of the surrounding landscape by identifying any yield increases in seed sets of canola as a proxy for yield against contributions by surrounding landscape. Statistical analysis, via ANOVA, was used to check for variance between seed sets from plants found at point measured 20m and 200m into the field across six different canola fields. Findings suggest no variation between seed sets at different distances into the field however significant variance between different growers. Therefore, there may be an effect of different landscape and growing conditions on the final seed sets of large-scale canola cultivation.},

We ask: 1) whether beta diversity of plants, pollinators, and interactions follow a similar trend across space, and 2) which interaction properties and site characteristics are related to the probability of turnover of pairwise interactions. Geographical distance was positively correlated with plant and interaction beta diversity. We find that locally frequent interactions are more consistent across space and that local flower abundance is important for the realization of pairwise interactions. While the identity of pairwise interactions is highly variable across space, some species-pairs form interactions that are locally frequent and spatially consistent. Such interactions represent cornerstones of interacting communities and deserve special attention from ecologists and conservation planners alike.},

Before each trial, colony energy stores were manipulated by enhancing or removing the contents of the colony's honey pots. Feeding bees were significantly more likely to flee from an artificial predator model (a black styrofoam ball moved overhead) when their colony's energy stores were enhanced, relative to when their colony's energy stores were depleted. Despite their defensive stings and aposematic coloration, bumble bees are more likely to accept “risky” foraging situations when the energy needs of their colony are increased.},

  Abstract                 = {Concern about biodiversity loss has led to increased public investment in conservation. Whereas there is a widespread perception that such initiatives have been unsuccessful, there are few quantitative tests of this perception. Here, we evaluate whether rates of biodiversity change have altered in recent decades in three European countries (Great Britain, Netherlands and Belgium) for plants and flower visiting insects. We compared four 20-year periods, comparing periods of rapid land-use intensification and natural habitat loss (1930-1990) with a period of increased conservation investment (post-1990). We found that extensive species richness loss and biotic homogenisation occurred before 1990, whereas these negative trends became substantially less accentuated during recent decades, being partially reversed for certain taxa (e.g. bees in Great Britain and Netherlands). These results highlight the potential to maintain or even restore current species assemblages (which despite past extinctions are still of great conservation value), at least in regions where large-scale land-use intensification and natural habitat loss has ceased.},

  abstract  = {1. There is considerable evidence for the negative impacts of habitat alteration on pollinators in highly disturbed regions of the world. However, it remains unclear whether these findings reflect a global crisis for crop pollination. Understanding the extent to which world agriculture is endangered by pollinator decline is essential if the economic valuation of nature is to be used to promote conservation.
2. We assess the susceptibility to pollinator limitation of one of the most important tropical and subtropical fruit crops, mango Mangifera indica L., commonly planted in a region of South Africa located between two large biodiversity-rich protected natural areas. We conducted flower visitor surveys, exclusion experiments and spatial analysis of flower visitation and fruit production patterns.
3. Our results show that both ants and flower visitors were effective pollinators of mango, the latter significantly declining (in abundance and species richness) with distance to natural habitat while ants were not affected. Neither the absence of pesticides nor the supplementation of flower visitors by using managed honeybees served to offset these negative impacts. Food-web data suggest that maintaining diversity of flower resources within farmland can help maintain pollinator communities.
4. Moreover, models based exclusively on pollinator abundance underestimated the negative effect of distance from natural habitat on production (42% less at 500 m from natural habitat). As soil nutrient levels and water content are regularly measured and corrected in all study sites, these results suggest that pollinator diversity may also be important.
5. Synthesis and applications. This study provides one of the first examples of marked pollination limitation in farms surrounded by well-protected natural habitat. For mango farming to be sustainable, it is essential to limit contiguous growth of farmland and consider practices that restore the complexity of plant-pollinator networks within farms, for example through the creation and maintenance of pollinator-friendly areas. By highlighting the economic gains of adopting pollinator-friendly practices in agriculture, this work contributes to a growing body of studies that reveal that making farmland more suitable for pollinators benefits both agriculture and nature conservation.},

  abstract  = {Ongoing expansion of large-scale agriculture critically threatens natural habitats and the pollination services they offer. Creating patches with high plant diversity within farmland is commonly suggested as a measure to benefit pollinators. However, farmers rarely adopt such practice, instead removing naturally occurring plants (weeds). By combining pollinator exclusion experiments with analysis of honeybee behaviour and flower-visitation webs, we found that the presence of weeds allowed pollinators to persist within sunflower fields, maximizing the benefits of the remaining patches of natural habitat to productivity of this large-scale crop. Weed diversity increased flower visitor diversity, hence ameliorating the measured negative effects of isolation from natural habitat. Although honeybees were the most abundant visitors, diversity of flower visitors enhanced honeybee movement, being the main factor influencing productivity. Conservation of natural patches combined with promoting flowering plants within crops can maximize productivity and, therefore, reduce the need for cropland expansion, contributing towards sustainable agriculture.},

In this study the habitat use of bumblebees was investigated on Salisbury Plain Training Area, the largest remaining area of unimproved chalk grassland in north-west Europe. Habitat characteristics influencing the overall abundance, species richness and foraging activity of bumblebees included the diversity and abundance of flowering plant species (particularly of favoured forage plants such as Trifolium pratense), vegetation structure and height. It is suggested that different Bombus species respond to these habitat characteristics depending on their specific foraging and nesting requirements, the case of Bombus humilis being especially relevant. The effects of several grassland management practices were considered in terms of their suitability for the conservation of bumblebee habitats. Cattle grazing was shown to be preferable to both sheep grazing and the absence of any management, although the timing and intensity of such grazing was important. Small-scale disturbances caused by vehicle activity were also of value in producing locally abundant forage resources in less intensively managed grasslands.},

  abstract  = {Insect pollinators such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are in global decline. A major cause of this decline is habitat loss due to agricultural intensification. A range of global and national initiatives aimed at restoring pollinator habitats and populations have been developed. However, the success of these initiatives depends critically upon understanding how landscape change affects key population-level parameters, such as survival between lifecycle stages, in target species. This knowledge is lacking for bumblebees, because of the difficulty of systematically finding and monitoring colonies in the wild. We used a combination of habitat manipulation, land-use and habitat surveys, molecular genetics and demographic and spatial modelling to analyse between-year survival of family lineages in field populations of three bumblebee species. Here we show that the survival of family lineages from the summer worker to the spring queen stage in the following year increases significantly with the proportion of high-value foraging habitat, including spring floral resources, within 250-1,000 m of the natal colony. This provides evidence for a positive impact of habitat quality on survival and persistence between successive colony cycle stages in bumblebee populations. These findings also support the idea that conservation interventions that increase floral resources at a landscape scale and throughout the season have positive effects on wild pollinators in agricultural landscapes.},

Opportunities to restore habitat for bumblebees on uncropped arable field margins are now available, although the methods by which this restoration can be achieved have not been fully investigated. We present the results of a three year study undertaken to investigate the response of foraging bumblebees to five different arable field margin treatments (sown and unsown), as part of a replicated field experiment on arable farmland in northern England (UK). Bumblebee abundance was closely linked to successional changes in availability of suitable forage plant species. Field margin treatments sown with a `grass and wildflower' mixture had the highest bumblebee abundance, and provided a consistent supply of forage species, with different components of the seed mixture flowering in each year. The unsown natural regeneration treatment attracted foraging bumblebees in only the second year due to the local abundance of thistles, so we consider this option to be both inconsistent in terms of forage provision and agronomically unacceptable. Our results are discussed in terms of developing suitable measures to achieve the restoration of habitats for bumblebees on arable farmland.},

Twentieth Century changes in range and frequency of these forage plants were assessed using data from the New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora (1930–1969 to 1987–1999) and the Countryside Surveys of Britain (1978–1998). Forage plants declined in both large-scale range and local-scale frequency between the two survey periods. These changes were of greater magnitude than changes in other native plant species, reflecting serious reductions in quality of foraging habitats for bees as well as a general decline in insect-pollinated plants. Seventy-six percent of forage plants declined in frequency within 1-km squares, including those (e.g. Trifolium pratense) of particular value for threatened bumblebee species. We consider how our findings relate to other recorded changes in the British flora, how they may help to explain declines in bumblebees and how they could contribute to a conservation strategy.},

  abstract  = {Self-incompatibility systems in plants are genetic systems that prevent self-fertilization in hermaphrodites through recognition and rejection of pollen expressing the same allelic specificity as that expressed in the pistils. The evolutionary properties of these self-recognition systems have been revealed through a fascinating interplay between empirical advances and theoretical developments. In 1939, Wright suggested that the main evolutionary force driving the genetic and molecular properties of these systems was strong negative frequency-dependent selection acting on pollination success. The empirical observation of high allelic diversity at the self-incompatibility locus in several species, followed by the discovery of very high molecular divergence among alleles in all plant families where the locus has been identified, supported Wright's initial theoretical predictions as well as many of its later developments. In the last decade, however, advances in the molecular characterization of the incompatibility reaction and in the analysis of allelic frequencies and allelic divergence from natural populations have stimulated new theoretical investigations that challenged some important assumptions of Wright's model of gametophytic self-incompatibility. We here review some of these recent empirical and theoretical advances that investigated: (i) the hypothesis that S-alleles are selectively equivalent, and the evolutionary consequences of genetic interactions between alleles; (ii) the occurrence of frequency-dependent selection in female fertility; (iii) the evolutionary genetics of self-incompatibility systems in subdivided populations; (iv) the evolutionary implications of the self-incompatibility locus's genetic architecture; and (v) of its interactions with the genomic environment.},

Because of these characteristics, deciduous species can rapidly translocate nutrients into new growth early in the season and are most vulnerable to herbivores at this time. In contrast, the evergreen Ledum has a constant large allocation of nutrients to leaves throughout the year; these nutrient reserves are always accessible to herbivores and are chemically protected to a corresponding degree. Removal of leaf nutrients by defoliation causes greater mortality and reduction in productivity in Ledum than in deciduous species. Defoliation of the graminoids Eriophorum and Carex results in a large nutrient investment in leaf regrowth. Under such circumstances roots increase phosphate absorption and respiration rates, which helps to maintain plant nutrient reserves. Root growth rate decreases following defoliation, but root mortality increases only after severe, chronic defoliation.},

Here we synthesize field data from {Arctic} Alaska, showing that terrestrial changes in summer albedo contribute substantially to recent high-latitude warming trends. Pronounced terrestrial summer warming in {Arctic} Alaska correlates with a lengthening of the snow-free season that has increased atmospheric heating locally by about 3 watts per square meter per decade (similar in magnitude to the regional heating expected over multiple decades from a doubling of atmospheric CO2). The continuation of current trends in shrub and tree expansion could further amplify this atmospheric heating by two to seven times.},

Crops vary in the degree to which they benefit from pollinators, and many of the most pollinator-dependent crops are also among the richest in micronutrients essential to human health. This study examines regional differences in the pollinator dependence of crop micronutrient content and reveals overlaps between this dependency and the severity of micronutrient deficiency in people around the world. As much as 50\% of the production of plant-derived sources of vitamin A requires pollination throughout much of Southeast Asia, whereas other essential micronutrients such as iron and folate have lower dependencies, scattered throughout Africa, Asia and Central America. Micronutrient deficiencies are three times as likely to occur in areas of highest pollination dependence for vitamin A and iron, suggesting that disruptions in pollination could have serious implications for the accessibility of micronutrients for public health. These regions of high nutritional vulnerability are understudied in the pollination literature, and should be priority areas for research related to ecosystem services and human well-being.},

  abstract  = {Organic farming is commonly associated with increased pollinator diversity and abundance, but the net effects on pollination rates are less documented. Besides, organic farms are often surrounded by more diverse landscapes than conventional farms, such that the contributions of landscape diversity vs. farming practices to pollination rates are often confounded with each other. Here, the roles of local vs. landscape scale variables on pollination rates of experimental plants are examined in agricultural landscapes. To this end, fruit set and seed production were measured in the obligate insect-pollinated Lotus corniculatus. Plants were located in pairs of neighboring organic vs. conventional farms, which were characterized by contrasting landscape structures and compositions. Fruit set, a proxy for pollinator visitation rates, was significantly related to landscape variables: fruit set was higher in farms close to a patch of semi-natural habitat, but lower in landscapes with a high cover of semi-natural habitats. Fruit set also correlated with local variables, such as habitat type, but not with farming type. Identical pollination rates in conventional and organic farms are likely due to similar diversities of habitats, crops and weeds in both farming types of the study area. These results therefore confirm that habitat diversity prevails over pesticide-free practices to explain the higher pollinator abundances usually observed in organic vs. conventional farms.},

  abstract  = {1. Interest in pollen-borne gene dispersal has grown with the cultivation of genetically modified plants. To date, both experimental data and models of oilseed rape (OSR) Brassica napus pollen movement at the landscape scale do not clearly differentiate between wind- and insect-mediated dispersal. Estimations of insect-mediated gene dispersal would be valuable for managing potential escapes of transgenes.
2. To quantify the intensity and spatial scale of pollen dispersal by insect pollinators in an agricultural landscape, bait points made of flowering male-sterile OSR that attract OSR pollinators were located at six distances (10-1100 m) from the closest OSR fields and feral populations. Flower-visiting insects were caught by net on these male-sterile flowers and were rubbed onto the stigmas of male-sterile OSR plants grown in a pollen-proof greenhouse to do a manual pollination of their flowers. In this way we were able to assess the insects’ OSR pollen load and seed production at each of the six distances. 
3. A large diversity of insects carried OSR pollen and contributed to seed production, but not pollen beetles Meligethes aeneus. Logistic regression analyses of the seed-set success from the manual pollination demonstrated that seed set significantly increased with the proximity of OSR fields, the size of the pollinating insect, and the main daily temperature. Seed set was not affected by the pollinating insect’s order or genus. Seed set, both observed and predicted by the model, was above zero for flowers pollinated with large bees caught at>1100 m from the nearest OSR field.
4. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides clear evidence that a large variety of insect species can transfer viable pollen between OSRplants over considerable distances. However, only 39.4%of the insects caught on male-sterile flowers carried OSR pollen. Our results provide valuable data to improve models of pollen dispersal for entomophilous crops at the landscape scale. These models are essential to help land-managers reduce pollen-borne gene dispersal from genetically modified plants to wild and cultivated relatives.},

Recent research on the dynamics with which bees store, manage and retrieve memories all have fundamental implications for how pollinators choose between flowers, and in turn for floral evolution. New findings regarding how attention, peak-shift phenomena, and speed-accuracy tradeoffs affect pollinator choice between flower species show that analyzing the evolutionary ecology of signal-receiver relationships can substantially benefit from knowledge about the neural mechanisms of visual and olfactory information processing.},

The ground resolution of the 37 GHz data used in this study is 0.25° × 0.25° (latitude × longitude) and is composited monthly from January 1979 to December 1985. The annual actual evaporation and primary productivity data are extracted from the literature and correspond to averages for 5° latitude bands from 75° N to 55°S, while the CO2 data are monthly observations at 20 globally distributed monitoring stations from August 1981 to July 1983. The satellite sensor data have been averaged for 7 years and then averaged zonally in 5° latitude bands to relate to evaporation and primary productivity, while the monthly satellite sensor data have been averaged from 75° N to 55° S to relate to the CO2 data. The temporal variation of CO2 concentration and the zonal variations of evaporation and primary productivity are shown to be highly correlated with the satellite sensor data. Evaporation and primary productivity for latitude bands in the Sahel zone of Africa appear anamolous when compared with the satellite sensor data, perhaps because the estimated evaporation and primary productivity values do not represent the recent drought conditions over the Sahel zone. Potential usefulness of the 37 GHz data for global biospheric and climate studies are suggested.},

  abstract            = {The input of nutrients into {Arctic} polar deserts, aided by some physical processes, can result in localized areas of high biological productivity--"micro-oases." We examined the vegetation cover, and microbial and nematode abundance in the polar desert and in 38 micro-oases at the Haughton impact crater, Devon Island, Arctic Canada. Our sites were split between the alluvial terraces along the banks of the Haughton River and the breccia deposits resulting from the asteroid or comet impact 22 Myr ago that flank the alluvial terraces. The alluvial terraces have a vegetation cover that ranges from 2 to 11% depending on substrate and water availability with a species richness of 5 in most locations. The vegetation cover on the breccia is much lower, between 0.02 and 3% depending on water availability. The micro-oases on both substrates support between 2 and 98% cover, but they are smaller and more sparsely distributed than similar features found in the Truelove Lowland, Devon Island, and on Bathurst Island. Microbial and nematode numbers were an order of magnitude greater inside the micro-oases compared to outside. Micro-oases are often dominated by a particular species, resulting in well-defined groups of micro-oases that were separated by TWINSPAN analysis. The micro-oases at Haughton Crater provide insights into the process of colonization of a substrate resulting from an asteroid or comet impact and the unique biological characteristics of such substrates.},

  abstract  = {Gene flow between cultivars within a landscape may lead to impurities that reduce harvest value. In OSR, as for most crops, impurity rates are expected to depend on the spatial distribution of crops over the landscape. However, in contrast to other well-studied crops such as maize, \{OSR\} crops generate seed banks in European agro-ecosystems. Gene flow is thus a spatio-temporal process which depends on cropping systems. We therefore aimed at identifying spatial variables that have an effect on regional or local harvest impurities, taking account of the time since the introduction of \{OSR\} crops in the regions and of cropping system. Gene flow was simulated over 36 field patterns cultivated with either 15% or 30% of \{OSR\} fields, among which 10% or 50% were GM, for three contrasted cropping systems, with the GeneSys software already used for \{EU\} co-existence studies. Through regression analyses, we determined spatial and agronomic factors that most affected harvest impurity rates of non-GM \{OSR\} after one or seven years of \{OSR\} cultivation. The cropping system was the main factor explaining regional harvest impurity rates. Its importance increased after six years of \{OSR\} cultivation. For a given cropping system, the regional impurity rate after one year increased linearly with the current proportion of \{GM\} crop. In contrast, impurity rates after six years largely depended on the proportions of \{OSR\} crop (GM or not) in the two preceding years. During the first year of \{OSR\} cultivation, local impurity rates were mostly explained by the distance to the closest \{GM\} field. After six years, these rates were mostly explained by the density of \{GM\} volunteers in the analysed field and, to a lesser degree, to that of volunteers in neighbour non-OSR fields. Cropping systems were most important in determining impurity rates and the way impurity rates related to regional or local factors. Determination of isolation distances to ensure harvest purity should thus consider past history of \{OSR\} cultivation in the area and, in particular, how current or future cropping systems will manage volunteers. Regression quantiles were fitted to the simulated data to determine regional rules (i.e. the maximum regional area of \{GM\} \{OSR\} and isolation distances between \{GM\} and non-GM crops) as a function of the risk accepted by the decision-maker (i.e. the % of situations exceeding harvest impurity thresholds), the cropping system and the volunteer infestation.},

  abstract  = {Evidence is given that insects acclimatized to colder temperatures are more resistant to immobilization by cold. There is a temperature below which further acclimatization is not achieved. Data are presented for the rate of gain and loss of cold tolerance. This is further evidence of acclimatization. The rate of recovery after immobilization by cold is related to the acclimatization temperatures. The rate of survival at low temperatures above freezing is dependent upon the acclimatization temperature.ZUSAMMENFASSUNGKÄLTE-AKKLIMATISATION BEI INSEKTEN1. Die experimentellen Daten zeigen, daß Blattella nach einer Akklimatisierungs-Temperatur von 15° C resistenter gegen Kälte ist als nach einer solchen von 25° C oder 35° C.2. Nach einer Akklimatisierungs-Temperatur von 10° C tritt Kältestarre bei der gleichen Temperatur ein wie nach einer Akklimatisierungs-Temperatur von 15° C. Dies zeigt, daß nach Unterschreiten einer Minimaltemperatur keine weitere Akklimatisierung stattfindet.3. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der eine Akklimatisation bei 15° C, 25° C und 35° C erfolgt, zeigt, daß die Depression der Temperatur für das Einsetzen der Kältestarre nicht durch einen Schockeffekt hervorgerufen wird.4. Die Geschwindigkeit, mit welcher eine Erholung aus der Kältestarre stattfindet, weist darauf hin, daß Blattella sich an verschiedene Temperaturen akklimatisieren kann.5. Die Reaktivierung von Blattella aus der Kältestarre wird bei niedrigen Temperaturen über dem Gefrierpunkt durch die Akklimatisierung beeinflußt. Nach einer Akklimatisierungs-Temperatur von 15° C überleben mehr Schaben als nach einer solchen von 25° C oder 35° C. Alle Schaben, die an eine Temperatur von 15° C akklimatisiert waren, starben schließlich bei 7° C, obwohl sie gegen Kälteeinwirkung resistenter waren als Schaben, die an eine Temperatur von 25° C oder 35° C akklimatisiert waren.6. Wie in der Diskussion der Ergebnisse ausgeführt wird, ist es unwahrscheinlich, daß ein Senken der für das Eintreten der Kältestarre notwendigen Temperatur um 2.6° C für freilebende Blattella bedeutungsvoll ist.},

Commercially-produced bumble bees used in greenhouse pollination often have higher levels of various pathogens than wild bumble bees. These pathogens may spread to wild bees when commercial bees escape from greenhouses and interact with their wild counterparts at nearby flowers. We examined the prevalence of four pathogens in wild bumble bee populations at locations near and distant to commercial greenhouses in southern Ontario, Canada. Bumble bees collected near commercial greenhouses were more frequently infected by those pathogens capable of being transmitted at flowers (Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi) than bees collected at sites away from greenhouses. We argue that the spillover of pathogens from commercial to wild bees is the most likely cause of this pattern and we discuss the implications of such spillover for bumble bee conservation.},

  abstract            = {A model is proposed to account for the level of diversity supported by any ecological community. If we begin with a hypothetical increase in the stability of the physical environment, the following consequences ensue. With greater environmental stability less energy is required for regulatory activities, that is, those which counter the challenges offered by the environment. Therefore, more energy is allocated for net productivity, that is, growth and reproduction. With increased net productivity, larger populations are supported. Larger populations provide more opportunities for the formation of interspecific associations; they also maintain greater genetic variety. Animals in more productive communities are more sedentary so that the species tends to be broken into many semi-isolated populations. As a result, speciation is favored with the interspecies associations providing the new adaptive opportunities. Plants which are pollinated by animals would be in the same situation. The new species tend to be more' specialized and to have, initially, smaller populations. These events are shown in Steps 1 to 5 in figure 1. in the early stages of the evolution of a community, positive feedback mechanisms would operate, ever-increasing the rate of speciation. The evolution of large heterotrophs (animals) would increase the rate of cycling of mineral nutrients, which would augment the net productivity. As more complex food webs developed with the increase in the number of species, community stability would increase, augmenting the stability of the physical environment. The clothing of the earth's surface with larger plants would tend to damp the fluctuations in climate, also increasing stability (Step 6). In the later stages, the tendency toward overspecialization and smaller populations would decrease community stability and provide a negative feedback control on the whole process (Steps 7 and 8). Even under very stable conditions, productivity may be limited directly by the short supply of various factors such as light, water, heat, etc. Population size may also be limited directly by a restriction in the area of suitable habitat or by a larger body size. Any such limitations would result in a lower diversity of species. This model applies only to equilibrium conditions. In certain situations, such as during the short favorable periods in the arctic or desert, diversity may be temporarily increased; care must be exercised in comparing this to the diversity maintained all the year in the wet tropics. We feel that, although some niches are determined by physical variations in the environment, most of the dimensions of the niche are a result of interaction between organisms. For this reason, it is impossible to predict the number of niches (and therefore species) from environmental complexity alone. We also discard the idea that rigorousness per se limits diversity. Lastly, the hypothesis that the tropics are closer to equilibrium while the temperate zone is in a "successional" state of development of diversity is not accepted, for theoretical reasons and for lack of evidence.},
  comment             = {This paper is weirdly impressive, in the same way that seeing how an conspiracy theorist views the world is. There's some huge sweeping claims, and bizarre-sounding connections, but in the end it's kind of interesting. It definitely supports Connell's view of plateauing evolution (similar to intermediate disturbance hypothesis), where evolution quickly generates new species, but then slows down as time goes on and species start to compete with each other.},

2. To predict whether a given species of social bee is worth testing as a pollinator in a given climate, it is useful to know at least the lower limits of that microclimatic ‘window’. We consider how information from a series of bee counts through a day can be used to characterize a bee species in terms of activity/microclimate relations as a basis for predicting the diel pattern of foraging activity of a bee introduced into a new climate as a pollinator.
3. We discuss the relative merits of bee counts at a foraging patch and counts based on hive traffic as indices of the proportion of bees active.
4. We suggest that the activity/microclimate relations of a species be expressed in terms of the lower threshold black globe temperature for flight activity. Black globe temperature, Tg, is easily measured with inexpensive equipment, and can substitute for measurements of ambient temperature and radiation as a predictor of diel patterns of bee activity.
5. We use examples of field data to explore the relationship between microclimate and activity for the honeybee Apis mellifera and several species of bumblebee, Bombus. Regression analysis is used to relate activity to Tg and to identify the lower temperature threshold for activity from field bee counts.
6. In field studies analysed here, the bumblebees Bombus terrestrisllucorum, B.pascuorum and B.hortorum began foraging at lower temperatures than honey-bees or B.lapidarius.},

One novel source of data to evaluate AESs may be provided by an organism that itself may benefit from them.

We analyzed landscape-level honeybee foraging ecology patterns over two years by decoding 5,484 waggle dances from bees located in the center of a mixed, urban-rural 94 km2 area, including lands under government- funded AESs. The waggle dance, a unique behavior performed by successful foragers, communicates to nestmates the most profitable foraging locations. After correcting for distance, dances demonstrate that honeybees possess a significant preference for rural land managed under UK Higher Level AESs and a significant preference against rural land under UK Organic Entry Level AESs. Additionally, the two most visited areas contained a National and Local Nature Reserve, respectively. Our study demonstrates that honeybees, with their great foraging range and sensitive response to forage quality, can be used as bioindicators to monitor large areas and provide information relevant to better environmental management.},

  abstract  = {In classical games that have been applied to ecology, individual fitness is either density independent or population density is fixed. This article focuses on the habitat selection game where fitness depends on the population density that evolves over time. This model assumes that changes in animal distribution operate on a fast time scale when compared to demographic processes. Of particular interest is whether it is true, as one might expect, that resident phenotypes who use density-dependent optimal foraging strategies are evolutionarily stable with respect to invasions by mutant strategies. In fact, we show that evolutionary stability does not require that residents use the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) at every population density; rather it is the combined resident-mutant system that must be at an evolutionary stable state. That is, the separation of time scales assumption between behavioral and ecological processes does not imply that these processes are independent. When only consumer population dynamics in several habitats are considered (i. e. when resources do not undergo population dynamics), we show that the existence of optimal foragers forces the resident-mutant system to approach carrying capacity in each habitat even though the mutants do not die out. Thus, the ideal free distribution (IFD) for the single-species habitat selection game becomes an evolutionarily stable state that describes a mixture of resident and mutant phenotypes rather than a strategy adopted by all individuals in the system. Also discussed is how these results are affected when animal distribution and demographic processes act on the same time scale.},

General frequency-dependent models of migratory dynamics that differ in the degree of animal omniscience are then developed. These models do not exclude migration at the IFD where balanced dispersal emerges. It is shown that the population distribution converges to the IFD even when animals are nonideal (i.e., they do not know the quality of all patches). In particular, the IFD emerges when animals never migrate from patches with a higher payoff to patches with a lower payoff and when some animals always migrate to the best patch. It is shown that some random migration does not necessarily lead to undermatching, provided migration occurs at the IFD. The effect of population dynamics on the IFD (and vice versa) is analyzed. Without any migration, it is shown that population dynamics alone drive the population distribution to the IFD. If animal migration tends (for each fixed population size) to the IFD, then the combined migration-population dynamics evolve to the population IFD independent of the two timescales (i.e., behavioral vs. population).},

The agricultural use of systemic insecticides, such as neonicotinoids, may harm bees through their presence in pollen and nectar, which bees consume. Many studies have tested the effects on honey bees of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid, but a clear picture of the risk it poses to bees has not previously emerged, because investigations are methodologically varied and inconsistent in outcome. In a meta-analysis of fourteen published studies of the effects of imidacloprid on honey bees under laboratory and semi-field conditions that comprised measurements on 7073 adult individuals and 36 colonies, fitted dose-response relationships estimate that trace dietary imidacloprid at field-realistic levels in nectar will have no lethal effects, but will reduce expected performance in honey bees by between 6 and 20%. Statistical power analysis showed that published field trials that have reported no effects on honey bees from neonicotinoids were incapable of detecting these predicted sublethal effects with conventionally accepted levels of certainty. These findings raise renewed concern about the impact on honey bees of dietary imidacloprid, but because questions remain over the environmental relevance of predominantly laboratory-based results, I identify targets for research and provide procedural recommendations for future studies.},

2. Progress across an array was measured as the distance bumblebees had moved away from an original plant location after eight subsequent, successive plant visits. Movements were analysed in units of both metres and inter-plant spaces. In both units, bumblebees progressed more slowly across patchily dispersed arrays.
3. Plant dispersion had a detectable effect on certain components of bees’ individual inter-plant moves (e.g. move length in metres) but not on others (e.g. mean turning angle). In some cases, the effects of aggregation on the components of individual moves were probably too small to detect statistically and only emerged in their cumulative effect on bees’ progress.
4. Over short sequences of plant visits, bumblebees revisited plants rarely, but the frequency of revisits was almost twice as high in patchy arrays as in uniform arrays, and economic penalties may result from foraging among highly aggregated plants.
5. The effects of plant dispersion on pollinator movements detected in this study are unlikely to have a major impact on pollen transfer in B. napus because differences in pollinator progress only emerged after several successive inter-plant flights away from a potential pollen source, by which time the limited extent of pollen carryover in this species means that fertilisations from the source plant would be very rare.},

2 The durations of flower visits by bumblebees increased with the amount of nectar, but were unaffected by the level of available pollen. The bees' flower-handling routine may have become behaviourally fixed by the expectation of low pollen rewards, which prevailed in the experimental garden.
3 The effects of nectar provision on both pollen import (deposition on stigma) and export (removal from anthers) were studied. The amount of pollen transferred during a bumblebee's visit was affected only by the amount of pollen that the flower presented.
4 Manipulated flowers that presented a large amount of available pollen received approximately three times more pollen on their stigmas during a bee's visit than flowers with little available pollen, which suggests that autogamous pollen transfer contributes substantially to pollen deposition when pollen availability is high. The gradual dehiscence of the anthers in this species means that available pollen accumulates only if pollinator visits are infrequent, when the increased autogamy may act to ensure adequate pollination.
5 There was no relation between the quantity of nectar residue that a bee left after visiting a manipulated flower and the mean duration of its visits to unmanipulated flowers. Therefore, variation among individuals in the duration of visits to unmanipulated flowers apparently resulted from differences in foraging speed rather than from variation in the thoroughness of nectar removal.},

Functional optimization by the seemingly exacting requirements of pollen transfer may account for these observations. I used the results of a literature survey to examine the levels of intraspecific variation in flowers across a wide range of taxa. The least variable attributes were those potentially affecting the mechanical fit between flower and pollinator, which are potentially constrained by selection for pollination performance. I discuss six mechanisms by which plant-pollinator interactions could generate stabilizing selection on flowers. In addition, I consider the stabilizing roles of limiting resources and also two functionally-neutral mechanisms. Further work is required to identify the actual mechanisms by which selection stabilizes the evolution of flowers.Copyright 1998 Annals of Botany Company},

Pollination by wind is feasible, however, and its likely effectiveness is not immediately foreseeable because of the complexity of interactions between objects and windborne particles. 
2 Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind-tunnel experiments were used to investigate the aerodynamic interactions between the flower and a windborne suspension of its pollen. 
3 The flower's petals handicapped wind pollination by reducing the target efficiency of the upwind-facing stigma. For downwind-facing flowers, pollen reception was negligible.
4 Several aspects of the plant's architecture (floral structure, pollen cohesiveness, inflorescence structure) are uncompromisingly zoophilous. Estimates of the amount of wind pollination suggest that it is unlikely to be important for the long-distance dispersal of B. napus genes such as those from genetically modified varieties. 
5 This study illustrates how CFD may become a powerful tool in future analyses of wind pollination.},

  abstract  = {Theory predicts that the susceptibility of patches of plants to gene flow mediated by incoming pollinators will depend on the length of pollinator residence (the number of flowers visited during a bout in a patch). We sought to determine whether pollinator residence is sufficiently sensitive to patch size and separation to influence levels of gene flow significantly. We studied oilseed rape Brassica napus as an exemplar of a conventional animal-pollinated plant and as a species where there is a risk of genetic escape from genetically modified (GM) varieties. 
We determined pollinator residence in 36 patches created by mowing an agricultural field of flowering oilseed rape. Each square patch had an edge length of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 m. Patches were separated by either 9 m or 18 m from the border of a large unmown area of crop. We used the residence of bumblebees (Bombus s) to solve a model of bumblebee-mediated gene flow. 
Bumblebee residence increased significantly with patch area, but did not depend on the separation distance of the patch from the large areas of crop. Even in the largest patches, bees visited only c. 60 of the c. 1 × 105 flowers before leaving. 
If bumblebees were the sole pollinators, the model predicted that 4-8% of the seed produced by the smaller patches (c. 80-320 plants) had fathers outside the patch, whereas in the larger patches (720-8000 plants) the prediction was 2-4%. Nevertheless, larger patches should produce the greatest number of seeds with extrinsic paternity. 
Synthesis and applications. Our observations demonstrate that susceptibility to pollinator-mediated gene flow is liable to decrease systematically as the size of plant patches increases. These findings can inform the management of genetic diversity in and among small or fragmented populations. If the patch size-gene flow relationship that we observed applies to larger scales, the model could estimate gene flow between GM crops and volunteer or feral populations in agricultural landscapes.},

  abstract  = {We present a model that predicts the level of gene flow mediated by animal pollinators from a source population to a sink population. The model requires specification of three elements: (1) the paternity that originates from a single flower, the paternity shadow; (2) the mean number of flowers that pollinators visit during stays in the sink population, the residence; (3) the proportion of pollinators arriving at the sink that carry pollen from the source population. Provided that pollinators visit enough flowers in the sink to exhaust the paternity shadows from the source, the general results are that gene flow is inversely proportional to the mean pollinator residence in the sink population, and is proportional to the fraction of pollinators arriving with pollen from the source. These results are used to propose explanations for two of the widely observed patterns in gene flow among plant populations. Numerical solutions to the model are derived using experimentally determined values of elements (1) and (2) that represent bumblebees, Bombus s, visiting agricultural fields of oilseed rape, Brassica napus L. In B. napus, the paternity shadow attenuates rapidly over approximately 20 recipient flowers. Mean bumblebee residences in the fields studied varied between 490 and 720 flowers. In the absence of a direct measurement of element (3), we calculated the maximum level of bumblebee-mediated gene flow by assuming that all bees arrived at the sink saturated with pollen from extrinsic sources. In this case, the model predicts that bumblebee-mediated gene flow accounted for between 0.1% and 0.5% of the progeny in the agricultural fields studied. A likelihood analysis of our observations is unable to reveal convincingly the proportion of bees arriving at the sink via a source population, but the literature suggests that bumblebees have high site fidelity, which implies that bee-mediated gene flow may be substantially less than our estimated maximum. We consider the role of various factors, including wind pollination, in accounting for the differences between the model's predictions and the generally higher levels of gene flow observed in previous studies of oilseed rape.},

Many studies have investigated how pollinators and floral resources covary in space, but few have looked at their covariance among years. I studied responses of two bee taxa, Bombus (a social genus) and Anthophora (a solitary genus), to variation in flowering by Astragalus scaphoides, a perennial herb that flowers in alternate years. First, I quantified the rate at which individual plants were visited by bees. Anthophora showed evidence of a demographic response to resource pulses—that is, more individuals were seen in the year after a high-flowering year—whereas Bombus did not. Second, I quantified pollinator behavior by following individual bees and recording the proportion of visits to A. scaphoides within single foraging bouts. The proportion of visits to A. scaphoides by both taxa increased with A. scaphoides’s flowering density. Higher specialization in high-flowering years likely makes both taxa better pollinators in high-flowering years. If these taxa differ in effectiveness as pollinators, then these responses translate into variation in pollination services in space and time, specifically, more activity by Bombus in high-flowering years and more by Anthophora in years following high-flowering years. They also emphasize that pollinator activity depends in part on past—as well as current—floral resources.},

  abstract  = {Abstract There is growing evidence globally that improved pollination practices can help support higher yield and reduced variability for a wide range of insect pollinated crops. Managed honeybees are provided to pollinate some orchard crops, but they are less commonly used for field crops, in part because of uncertainty as to whether the potential benefits are justified by the costs. This uncertainty comes from a lack of studies conducted at the appropriate scale. In this study we examine the yield benefits from managed honeybees applied to Vicia faba in field scale trials. We provided honeybee hives to 17 fields in South Australia, and observed that bee activity and fruits per stem decreased with increasing distance from hives. We examined the spatial pattern of yield using yield map data collected at harvest and found there was an effect of distance from hives on mean yield (declining with distance) and spatial variability of yield (increasing with distance). The presence of a distance gradient was consistent across all fields, across two years, two V. faba varieties and two different bee-hive management methods. The average benefit is estimated to be an additional 17% yield, 90% of which is attained within 767m of hives. Our economic analysis indicates that provision of hives is profitable for a wide range of realistic values for crop value (dollars per tonne) and pollination cost (dollars per hive).},

These were tested by first examining patterns of species richness of birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles in 336 quadrats covering North America. These patterns were then compared with the regional variation of 21 descriptors of the environment suggested by the hypotheses. I found that, in the four vertebrate classes studied, 80%-93% of the variability in species richness could be statistically explained by a monotonically increasing function of a single variable: annual potential evapotranspiration (PET). In contrast, tree richness is more closely related to actual evapotranspiration (AET). Both AET and PET appear to be measures of available environmental energy. The relationships between tree and vertebrate richness are strikingly poor. Species richness in particular orders and families of the Vertebrata is also closely related to PET, but not always monotonically, often resembling a replacement series along an environmental gradient. The present results are consistent with the hypothesis that environmentally available energy limits regional species richness. However, my observations are not completely consistent with earlier species-energy theory. The energy-richness relationship appears to depend on scale, and it is affected differently by variations in area and in areal energy flux.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND Neonicotinoid insecticides have been the target of much scrutiny as possible causes of recent declines observed in pollinator populations. Although neonicotinoids have been implicated in honey bee pesticide incidents, there has been little examination of incident report data. Here we summarize honey bee incident report data obtained from the Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA).
RESULTS In Canada, there were very few honey bee incidents reported in 2007-2011 and data were not collected prior to 2007. In 2012, a significant number of incidents were reported in the province of Ontario, where exposure to neonicotinoid dust during planting of corn was suspected to have caused the incident in up to 70% of cases. Most of these incidents were classified as ‘minor’ by the PMRA, and only six cases were considered ‘moderate’ or ‘major’. In that same year, there were over three times as many moderate or major incidents due to older non-neonicotinoid pesticides, involving numbers of hives or bees far greater than the number of moderate or major incidents suspected to be due to neonicotinoid poisoning.
CONCLUSIONS These data emphasize that, while exposure of honey bees to neonicotinoid-contaminated dust during corn planting needs to be mitigated, other pesticides also pose a risk. 2013 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract  = {‘Kent’ mango (Mangifera indica L.) flowers were sampled in an orchard in the coastal plain of Israel during the 1997 flowering season. Effective pollination rate was determined at two stages of the fertilization process: (a) pollen germination on the stigma; (b) pollen-tube penetration into the ovule. Pollination rates were negligible during the first part of the flowering season (31 March to 18 April), reaching a high value only at the end of the season (21 May). The same phenomenon also occurred, albeit with consistently higher rates of effective pollination, when detached flowers, taken from the orchard during the flowering season, were pollinated and incubated for 24 h at the presumed optimal temperature of 30°C, indicating that the reproductive organs were not fully functionally viable. At the start of the flowering season, all the pollen was deformed, and later (16 April 1997), when pollen grain shape was normal, only 23% of it was found to be viable by Alexander’s staining. The functional viability of the pollen and pistils of orchard- and phytotron-grown (22/27°C, night/day) flowers was determined in detached flowers. At the beginning of the flowering season, both orchard pollen and pistils tended to be defective. Orchard pollen germinated poorly, even on phytotron adapted stigmas. Ovule penetration was hampered in orchard pistils, even when phytotron pollen was used for pollination. Chilling injury appeared to be responsible for the damage to the reproductive organs of the orchard flowers. The negligible rate of effective pollination found in mango orchards in Israel during a significant part of the flowering season therefore appears to be due to the detrimental effect of cold weather on the pollination and fertilization processes as well as on the functional viability of the male and female reproductive organs.},

We studied five such plants in deciduous forests and agricultural fields in west-central Indiana, USA: three native forest herbs [Claytonia virginica L., Dentaria laciniata Muhlenb. ex Willd., Erigenia bulbosa (Michaux) Nutt.] and two exotic agricultural weeds [Barbarea vulgaris R. Br., Stellaria media L. (Vill.)], which often grow in close proximity. Using spectrophotometry, we measured daily sugar accumulation (in caged flowers) and standing crops (in uncaged flowers) at two sites on four dates per species. Dentaria laciniata was the most rewarding species (mean daily accumulations: 185-404 ug sugar/ flower), followed by moderately rewarding B. vulgaris and C. virginica (24-113 ug sugar/flower) and low rewarding E. bulbosa and S. media (7-38 ug sugar/flower). The presence of species with similar rewards in both habitats suggests that generalist bee and fly species can be expected to forage in both. Each flower species showed much variation in mean sugar accumulation per flower among population samples and among individual plants. Solitary bees were the most common visitors to all species (47 to 81% of visitation), followed by flies and honey bees. Insects consumed much, but not all (45 to 90%) of daily nectar accumulation by the five species. The more sugar a flower population secreted, on average, the higher its standing crop; visitation did not reduce rewards to a common level.},

Two widespread structures in ecological networks are modularity, i.e. weakly connected subgroups of species that are internally highly interlinked, and nestedness, i.e. specialist species that interact with a subset of those species with which generalist species also interact. Modularity and nestedness are often interpreted as evolutionary ecological structures that may have relevance for community persistence and resilience against perturbations, such as climate-change. Therefore, historical climatic fluctuations could influence modularity and nestedness, but this possibility remains untested. This lack of research is in sharp contrast to the considerable efforts to disentangle the role of historical climate-change and contemporary climate on species distributions, richness and community composition patterns. Here, we use a global database of pollination networks to show that historical climate-change is at least as important as contemporary climate in shaping modularity and nestedness of pollination networks. Specifically, on the mainland we found a relatively strong negative association between Quaternary climate-change and modularity, whereas nestedness was most prominent in areas having experienced high Quaternary climate-change. On islands, Quaternary climate-change had weak effects on modularity and no effects on nestedness. Hence, for both modularity and nestedness, historical climate-change has left imprints on the network structure of mainland communities, but had comparably little effect on island communities. Our findings highlight a need to integrate historical climate fluctuations into eco-evolutionary hypotheses of network structures, such as modularity and nestedness, and then test these against empirical data. We propose that historical climate-change may have left imprints in the structural organisation of species interactions in an array of systems important for maintaining biological diversity.},

Quantitative estimates of the gene dispersal from fields with GM-crops to fields with conspecific non-GM-crops (conventional or organic) are therefore needed in order to suggest isolation distances and other management strategies to keep GM-pollination below acceptable threshold values. A meta-analysis of available gene-flow data for oilseed rape (Brassica napus) was performed. The probability distribution that seeds of non-GM-oilseed rape are fertilised by foreign pollen grains from a neighbouring field of GM-oilseed rape is modelled as functions of the width of the recipient (i.e. pollen receiving) field and the distance to the pollen donor fields. Furthermore, the significance of using a buffer zone (removal of a 1-5m border of a recipient field parallel to the pollen donor field) to reduce GM-pollination of the crop, is quantified and discussed. The predicted median and 95% credibility level of the probability of foreign pollination is calculated as a function of the width of the recipient field and the buffer zone, as well as the distance between fields. Analysis of different management strategies shows that an increasing isolation distance is more effective to reduce GM-pollen dispersal than the use of a buffer zone, especially for small recipient fields. The analysis shows that increasing the width of a recipient oilseed rape field, relative to the pollen donor field, will have a large effect on reducing the average level of fertilisation by foreign pollen within the recipient field. The results indicate that a GM-pollination percentage &lt;0.1% will be possible if the isolation distance exceeds 100m and the width of the non-GM-field is larger than 200m. If a threshold value of 0.3% is acceptable, an isolation distance of 50m should be sufficient even for smaller fields. The use of a 5m discarded buffer zone surrounding the non-GM-field is expected to reduce GM-pollination by about a third. The implications of the results for field management in conventional and organic farming are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Many insect species live in the {Arctic} and show a wide range of adaptations to its extreme severity and seasonality. Long, cold winters are met, for example, by cold hardiness and choice of protected sites. Cold hardiness includes both widespread tolerance to freezing and extreme supercooling ability, as well as unusual responses in a few species, such as lack of typical cryoprotectants. Adaptations to short, cool summers include activity at low temperatures, selection of warm habitats and microhabitats, melanism and hairiness coupled with basking behaviour, and prolonged or abbreviated life cycles. Diapause ensures that many species emerge early in summer, with brief synchronized reproduction that maximizes the time for offspring development before winter returns. Some species overwinter in sites that thaw earliest in spring, even if they are relatively exposed in winter. Other adaptations respond to year-to-year variability: for example, prolonged diapause can provide insurance against unsuitable summers. All of these adaptations are co-ordinated. For example, cold hardiness relies on physiological and biochemical adaptations but also on habitat choice and timing. Because the adaptations are complex, predicted climatic warming probably will have unexpected effects. In particular, an increase in temperature that increases summer cloud when sea ice melts would likely reduce temperatures for insect development and activity, because sunshine provides critical warmth to insects and their microhabitats. Changes in moisture will also be important. Moreover, responses differ among species, depending especially on their microhabitats. The complexity of the responses of insects to {Arctic} conditions reinforces the need for research that is sufficiently detailed.},

  abstract  = {Factors affecting the winter survival of temperate-zone insects are reviewed. Certain species suffer high winter mortality especially in cold years, or in years with below normal amounts of insulating snow.

Survival depends on the choice of winter microhabitat and on cold-hardiness, but also on biological features that have not previously been emphasized. These include behaviour that results in placement of overwintering eggs in less severe sites and manufacture of cocoons or other structures that retard inoculation by ice, or desiccation. The possible role of habitat heterogeneity in facilitating population survival is stressed.

Microhabitats are characterized mainly with respect to temperature. They differ markedly among geographic areas and not only in midwinter conditions (including the extent of variation), but also in the time at which entry to the microhabitat in fall is necessary to avoid the risk of frost. The cues that govern entry into these microhabitats include negative phototaxis in many species but have not been subjected to quantitative analysis. Deeper layers are warmer in winter but warm up more slowly in spring and therefore some species, especially in {Arctic} habitats where rapid vernal development is advantageous because the season is short, overwinter in superficial or insolated sites.

Supposed mechanisms of cold- and freezing-injury and its avoidance are reviewed. There are several theories of freezing-injury: many modem theories focus on damage to the cell membrane, apparently caused by changes in cell volume induced during freezing. Injury is avoided by suppression of haemolymph nucleators (enhancing supercooling); or by a variety of methods, especially those involving solutes, minimising damage to frozen tissues. Among these solutes, the prevalence of glycerol in overwintering insects is not unexpected since glycerol is a normal metabolite in animals and can play several possible roles in cryoprotection.

Cold-hardiness is metabolically costly because of these solute adjustments. The cold-hardiness of a taxon depends partly on climatic history during its evolution. Faunal composition at the highest latitudes reflects this dependence.

The winter survival of many high-latitude insects varies rather widely from year to year; but the many detailed studies on cold-hardiness that have been made in the laboratory have seldom been related to natural mortality.

The overwintering stage depends partly on the taxon. It is often fixed within a genus, but less closely within higher taxa. Proportionately more species overwinter as larvae at higher latitudes, especially when the life cycle lasts more than one year. Habitat also influences the overwintering stage: aquatic species generally overwinter as larvae, although species of temporary pools frequently overwinter as eggs. Overwintering in more than one stage is not common.

This review suggests that winter survival of a group depends on latitude (or its climatic equivalent), habitat, and evolutionary history. It might therefore be especially useful to compare cold-hardiness, developmental rates, control of the life cycle and other features among species at the same latitude from each extreme of a series, that contrasts cold-hardy groups in stable habitats (such as Chironomidae) with aerial or vegetation dwelling groups that are not cold-hardy (such as Orthoptera). Future study of winter survival also demands more ecological data (overwintering stage, microhabitat, and conditions experienced there) for a larger sample of the fauna, and the simultaneous measurement of cold-hardiness.},

Here we present a review of studies that produced quantitative assessments of both pollinator diversity and evenness as well as pollen limitation of focal plant species. Although pollen limitation is expected to be lower when pollinator diversity is high, our analysis suggests this relationship is weak. The relationship may be obscured when features of the plant species (e.g., average level of specialization) are confounded with features of the plant communities (e.g., habitat). We encourage researchers investigating pollen limitation to consider including measures of diversity of the floral visitors, and their effectiveness. These data would permit a more powerful test of the relationships among these variables and improve our understanding of the critical elements of stable plant-pollinator networks.

Earlier studies have shown the presence of stamens does not increase seed set through increased visitation by insects. Insects may, however, increase pollen deposition on stigmas and increase pollen competition. This paper examines: 1) pollen deposition levels in natural populations and 2) whether larger pollen loads lead to higher quality offspring. The majority of stigmas in two populations received less than 15 grains, but a small proportion had large loads. The latter may represent the occasional insect visit. These visits may provide the opportunity for pollen tube competition. In the greenhouse, flowers receiving heavy-pollen loads had higher seed set than flowers receiving light-pollen loads. Seeds from the two treatments were the same mass, had similar germination times, and seedlings had the same mass. In conclusion, it does not appear that pollen tube competition can account for the maintenance of stamens in females of T. pubescens.},

Honey bees (Apis mellifera L) learn to visit these perforations and thus become secondary nectar thieves. We tested the hypothesis that honey bees make this behavioral switch in response to an energetic advantage realized by nectar-robbing flower visits. Nectar volume and sugar quantity were higher in intact than perforated flowers, but bees (robbers) visiting perforated flowers were able to extract a higher percentage of available nectar and sugar so that absolute amount of sugar (mg) removed by one bee visit is the same for each flower type. However, because perforated flowers facilitate higher rates of bee flower visitation and the same or higher rates of nectar ingestion, they are rendered more profitable than intact flowers in temporal terms.

  abstract  = {[Translated] The authors studied insect pollinators of canola (Brassica napus L. var oleifera) Delile, in 4 locations of Wallonie (southern Belgium) from 1984 to 1985.

The most important species of pollinators were social Apidae: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris, B. lucorum, B. cryptarum, and Pyrobombus lapidarius. Honeybees visit the nectaries of canola using 3 different methods. In the "climbing-over" method, after the first nectary, the bee climbed over the style to visit the second. In the "bypassing" method, after the first nectary, the bee went around the style to get to the second nectary. In the "inserting" method, the bee inserted its tongue from the outside of the corolla between the base of the petals (nectar theiving). Only the first method deposited pollen on the stigma. Bumblebees used only the first method.

In the fields provided with hives, honeybees used the second and third foraging methods most frequently, with consequently low pollination. In a single field without hives, bumblebees were more abundant than honeybees, non-aggresive, and used the "climbing-over" method.

The rates of visitation were: 10.6-14 fls/min (Apis mellifera), 32.3 (B. terrestris), 30.5 (B. lucorum), 31.2 (B. cryptarum), 38.6 (P. lapidarius).

In the fields provided with hives, due to unfavorable pollinating behaviour by honeybees, bumblebees appear to be the best pollinator, due to their speed at foraging, and despite their low relative abundance.},

  Abstract                 = {Pollinator and/or mate scarcity affects pollen transfer, with important ecological and evolutionary consequences for plant reproduction. However, the way in which the pollen loads transported by pollinators and deposited on stigmas are affected by pollination context has been little studied. We investigated the impacts of plant mate and visiting insect availabilities on pollen transport and receipt in a mass-flowering and facultative autogamous shrub (Rhododendron ferrugineum). First, we recorded insect visits to R. ferrugineum in plant patches of diverse densities and sizes. Second, we analyzed the pollen loads transported by R. ferrugineum pollinators and deposited on stigmas of emasculated and intact flowers, in the same patches. Overall, pollinators (bumblebees) transported much larger pollen loads than the ones found on stigmas, and the pollen deposited on stigmas included a high proportion of conspecific pollen. However, comparing pollen loads of emasculated and intact flowers indicated that pollinators contributed only half the conspecific pollen present on the stigma. At low plant density, we found the highest visitation rate and the lowest proportion of conspecific pollen transported and deposited by pollinators. By contrast, at higher plant density and lower visitation rate, pollinators deposited larger proportion of conspecific pollen, although still far from sufficient to ensure that all the ovules were fertilized. Finally, self-pollen completely buffered the detrimental effects on pollination of patch fragmentation and pollinator failure. Our results indicate that pollen loads from pollinators and emasculated flowers should be quantified for an accurate understanding of the relative impacts of pollinator and mate limitation on pollen transfer in facultative autogamous species.},

  abstract  = {1. Evaluation of our ability to predict cross-pollination rates (CPR) at long distance using dispersal functions estimated in experimental set-ups differing by either their scale or their environmental conditions is crucial to establish appropriate management rules following the release of genetically modified (GM) crops.
2. From 1998 to 2004 we measured oilseed rape CPR in commercial fields for 44 donor-recipient couples separated by 220 up to 2000 m, from up to three different pollen donor cultivars in two French oilseed rape production areas. We followed the same sampling and screening designs and tested the effect of region, year, size, cultivar and distance on the observed CPR. 
3. We then compared observed CPR to predictions from six empirical pollen dispersal models based on dispersal kernels that were fitted previously at the local and landscape scales. These predictions allowed us to test the possibility to extrapolate and up-scale dispersal kernels. 
4. The observed CPR varied from 0% to 0.092%. They were higher in Champagne-Ardennes, where they depended negatively on distance, than in Bourgogne where they did not depend on distance. CPR also differed among years, being nil for the last 3 successive years, partly because of different environmental conditions and detection issues. CPR depended further on the source cultivars due to differences in pollen production. Dispersal kernels fitted at the local scale lead to systematic and huge underestimation of CPR, when observed. The power-law kernel fitted at the landscape scale under-estimated CPR by two orders of magnitude above 400 m but followed the rate of decrease of the observed pollination with distance.
5. Synthesis and applications. Caution should be taken when extrapolating and up-scaling dispersal kernels and models because predictions may differ greatly from observations. Models should rely at least upon dispersal kernels estimated from landscape-scale data obtained in different regions. Models should also integrate several phenomena at the agro-ecosystem scale including the dispersal by insects and become more mechanistic to account for variations observed among years, environments and distance to borders.},

For this purpose, we estimated the diversity and origin of fertilizing pollen in a 10 × 10 km French oilseed rape production area. First, the cultivar grown in each field was identified through surveys to farmers and using microsatellite markers. Examination of the seed set in fields indicated high rates of seed contamination (8.7%) and pollination from other sources (5%). Then, male-sterile plants were scattered over the study area and their seed genotyped using the same markers. Most pollination was local: 65% of the seeds had a compatible sire in the closest field, i.e. at 50 or 300 m depending on site, but the nearest compatible field was found more than 1000 m away for 13% of the seeds. To assess the diversity of fertilizing pollen, each seed was assigned to the nearest putative siring cultivar. The observed diversity of pollen was then compared to that predicted by simulations using three empirical dispersal models with increasing proportion of long-distance pollination. The diversity was sensitive to the dispersal kernel used in the simulations, fatter-tailed functions predicting higher diversities. The dispersal kernel that was more consistent with our data predicted more long-distance dispersal than the exponential function.},

  abstract  = {This paper considers the extent to which differences in pollen tube growth rates can provide prezygotic reproductive isolation between Mimulus nasutus and its presumed progenitor, Mimulus guttatus. Mimulus nasutus is partially cleistogamous, but its larger chasmogamous flowers offer appreciable opportunity for outcrossing. Mimulus nasutus was found to have smaller pollen grains and shorter styles than M. guttatus. No differences were observed in pollen grain germination on conspecific and heterospecific stigmas. However, pollen tube growth rates of M. nasutus were found to be much slower than those of M. guttatus in the styles of that species. Consequently, any M. nasutus pollen transferred to an M. guttatus stigma was found to be competitively disadvantaged in an M. gutattus style. By contrast, no difference in pollen tube growth rate was detected between the species when growing in M. nasutus styles, possibly because M. nasutus styles are unable to support fast pollen tube growth. We tested the prediction from the pollen tube studies that a 50:50 mix of M. guttatus and M. nasutus pollen would produce 50% hybrid seeds when M. nasutus was the maternal parent, and near to 0% hybrid seed when M. guttatus was the maternal parent. The results were found to support this prediction. We conclude that pollen-pistil interactions can effect strong reproductive isolation between these species, as M. guttatus pollen tubes have a competitive advantage over those of M. nasutus in an M. guttatus style, but not in an M. nasutus style.},

  abstract  = {1. New incentives at the national and international level frequently lead to substantial structural changes in agricultural landscapes. Subsidizing energy crops, for example, recently fostered a strong increase in the area cultivated with oilseed rape Brassica napus across the EU. These changes in landscape structure affect biodiversity and associated ecosystem services.
2. Mass-flowering oilseed rape has been shown to positively affect colony growth and densities of bumblebees, which may enhance pollination services in agroecosystems. Not considered, however, have been species-specific traits of pollinators resulting in disproportionate benefits from these recurrent resource pulses. A subsequent community shift towards the subsidized species potentially distorts plant-pollinator interactions in the surrounding landscape.
3. We analysed the effects of mass-flowering crops on the abundance of legitimate long-tongued bumblebee pollinators, nectar robbing by illegitimate short-tongued bumblebees and seed set in the long-tubed flowers of red clover Trifolium pratense in 12 landscape sectors with differing amounts of oilseed rape.
4. Densities of long-tongued bumblebees visiting long-tubed plants decreased with increasing amounts of oilseed rape. The simultaneous increase of nectar robbing suggests that resource depletion is a likely explanation for this decline which may lead to a distortion in plant-pollinator interactions. The decline in long-tongued bumblebees, however, did not result in an immediate effect on seed set. In contrast, seed set increased with increasing amounts of semi-natural habitats, indicating the positive effects of these habitats on the legitimate long-tongued pollinators.
5.Synthesis and applications. Accounting for species-specific traits is essential in evaluating the ecological impacts of land-use change. The disproportional trait-specific benefits of increasing oilseed rape to short-tongued bumblebees may abet an increasingly pollinator-dependent agriculture but simultaneously threaten the more specialized and rare long-tongued species and their functions. Semi-natural habitats were found to positively affect seed set in long-tubed plants indicating that they can counteract the potentially distorting effects of transient mass-flowering crops on plant-pollinator interactions in agroecosystems. Future agri-environmental schemes should aim to provide diverse and continuous resources matching trait-specific requirements of various pollinators in order to avoid resource competition. Thereby they harmonize the economic interest in abundant pollinators and the conservation interest in protecting rare species.},

  abstract  = {Considerable uncertainties exist on how increased biofuel cropping affects biodiversity. Regarding oilseed rape, the most common biofuel crop in the EU, positive responses of flower-visiting insects to plentiful nectar and pollen seem apparent. However, previous investigations on this insect guild revealed conflicting results, potentially because they focused on different taxonomic groups representing a narrow range of ecological traits and considered only short time periods. Here, using trap nests in landscapes with independent gradients in area of oilseed rape and seminatural habitats, we assessed the whole community of cavity-nesting bees and wasps, including early- and late-emerging species. Our study's temporal resolution allowed determination of flowering and postflowering effects of oilseed rape on these species' richness, abundance, and mortality. Species richness of cavity-nesting bees and wasps significantly increased with oilseed rape, although nesting activity was considerably higher after mass flowering. In addition to increasing richness independently of oilseed rape, the amount of seminatural habitat in the landscape was the sole positive driver of insect abundance once the community's dominant species was accounted for as a covariate. Thus, growth of the co-occurring species' community is not stimulated by the resource pulse provided by oilseed rape early in the year, but by persistent resources provided by seminatural habitats after mass flowering. Early individuals of bivoltine species' first generations accumulated in seminatural habitats when these habitats were scarce, but became increasingly diluted when habitat availability increased. Once established, later foraging females generally benefited from the resource availability of seminatural habitats when initializing the second generation. We conclude that mass-flowering crops, despite covering only a short interval of the community's main activity phase, benefit bee and wasp species richness. However, seminatural habitats are crucial in maintaining viable communities of flower-visiting insects at the landscape scale, mitigating potential negative effects of high land-use intensities in modern agro-ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {Open Top Chambers (OTCs) were used to measure impacts of predicted global warming on the structure of the invertebrate community of a Dryas octopetala heath in West Spitsbergen. Results from the OTC experiment were compared with natural variation in invertebrate community structure along a snowmelt transect through similar vegetation up the adjacent hillside. Changes along this transect represent the natural response of the invertebrate community to progressively longer and potentially warmer and drier growing seasons. Using MANOVA, ANOVA, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Chi-squre tests, significant differences in community composition were found between OTCs and controls and among stations along the transect. Numbers of cryptostigmatic and predatory mites tended to be higher in the warmer OTC treatment but numbers of the aphid Acyrthosiphon svalbardicum, hymenopterous parasitoids, Symphyta larvae, and weevils were higher in control plots. Most Collembola, including Hypogastrura tullbergi, Lepidocyrtus lignorum and Isotoma anglicana, followed a similar trend to the aphid, but Folsomia bisetosa was more abundant in the OTC treatment. Trends along the transect showed clear parallels with the OTC experiment. However, mite species, particularly Diapterobates notatus, tended to increase in numbers under warming, with several species collectively increasing at the earlier exposed transect stations. Overall, the results suggest that the composition and structure of Arctic invertebrate communities associated with Dryas will change significantly under global warming.},

  abstract  = {The honey bee dance language, used to recruit nestmates to food sources, is regarded by many as one of the most intriguing communication systems in animals. What were the ecological circumstances that favoured its evolution? We examined this question by creating experimental phenotypes in which the location information of the dances was obscured. Surprisingly, in two temperate habitats, these colonies performed only insignificantly worse than colonies which were able to communicate normally. However, foraging efficiency was substantially impaired in an Asian tropical forest following this manipulation. This indicates that dance language communication about food source locations may be important in some habitats, but not in others. Combining published data and our own, we assessed the clustering of bee forage sites in a variety of habitats by evaluating the bees' dances. We found that the indicated sites are more clustered in tropical than in temperate habitats. This supports the hypothesis that in the context of foraging, the dance language is an adaptation to the particular habitats in which the honey bees evolved. We discuss our findings in relation to spatial aggregation patterns of floral food in temperate and tropical habitats.},

  abstract  = {Information about food sources can be crucial to the success of a foraging animal. We predict that this will influence foraging decisions by group-living foragers, which may sacrifice short-term foraging efficiency to collect information more frequently. This result emerges from a model of a central-place forager that can potentially receive information on newly available superior food sources at the central place. Such foragers are expected to return early from food sources, even with just partial loads, if information about the presence of sufficiently valuable food sources is likely to become available. Returning with an incomplete load implies that the forager is at that point not achieving the maximum possible food delivery rate. However, such partial loading can be more than compensated for by an earlier exploitation of a superior food source. Our model does not assume cooperative foraging and could thus be used to investigate this effect for any social central-place forager. We illustrate the approach using numerical calculations for honeybees and leafcutter ants, which do forage cooperatively. For these examples, however, our results indicate that reducing load confers minimal benefits in terms of receiving information. Moreover, the hypothesis that foragers reduce load to give information more quickly (rather than to receive it) fits empirical data from social insects better. Thus, we can conclude that in these two cases of social-insect foraging, efficient distribution of information by successful foragers may be more important than efficient collection of information by unsuccessful ones.},

This is despite unambiguous evidence for conflict between the partners and the existence of cheats that use benefits derived from their partners while providing reduced or no services in return. Evidence from a diversity of associations suggests that symbioses are robust to cheating in several ways. Some symbioses persist despite conflict and cheating because of the selective advantage of cost-free interactions (also known as byproduct mutualistic interactions), which incur no conflict. There is also evidence for the suppression of cheating by sanctions imposed by partners in some symbioses, and vertical transmission has been shown experimentally to promote traits that enhance partner performance. It is argued that these processes contribute to the apparent rarity of evolutionary transitions from symbiosis to parasitism. There is strong phylogenetic evidence for the evolutionary reversion of various symbiotic organisms to free-living lifestyles, but at least some of these transitions can be attributed to selection pressures other than within-symbiosis conflict. The principal conclusion is that, although conflict is common in symbioses, it is generally managed and contained.},

  abstract  = {Optimal foraging theory predicts that foragers should distribute themselves on a variable resource so that individual food intake rate is the same at all local areas or patches. The number of nectar foraging bumblebees on plants varying in size (Viscaria vulgaris) was proportional to the number of open flowers per plant, and on plants varying in rate of nectar production per flower (Anchusa officinalis) proportional to the nectar production per plant. These distributions result in a nectar gain per flower which is independent of plant size and rate of nectar production per flower. A computer simulation showed that the distribution of the bees and the equalization of the gain per flower can partly be explained by the bees' systematic searching for nectar, and partly by a non-random plant choice. The bees search systematically by using an optimal rejection threshold gain to avoid recently depleted flowers. The non-random plant choices consist in preferences for large plants and high nectar producers. At stands varying in plant density (Viscaria vulgaris), bee and flower densities were proportional, which also results in a constant gain per flower. This distribution is explained by a preference for foraging on dense stands and maybe by a systematic searching among the plants.},

However, other selective agents, including predators, seed feeders, and herbivores, may affect pollination systems. Because flowers are predictable food sources for a variety of species, flowers are also reliable sites at which predators can locate flower-visiting animals. Prominent among pollinators' predators are beewolves (Philanthus spp.), common sphecid wasps (Sphecidae) that prey almost exclusively on bees. My fieldwork over three years indicates first, that an area of ~50 km2 surrounding a single bumble bee wolf (Philanthus bicinctus) aggregation had a low bumble bee (Bombus spp.) density caused by intense predation by the wasps, and second, that fruit-set of the bumble bee-pollinated western monkshood (Aconitum columbianum) was significantly lower at locations and times of bumble bee wolf activity than at control locations and times with no such predatory activity. These results indicate that predation can sometimes alter plant-pollinator interactions.},

We compare predictions for solitary and social provisioners, and for three foraging currencies. When distinct food patches with identical food parameters are considered, fewer provisioners use the farther patches. The rate of decline in number of provisioners depends on the currency used. With net rate of energy intake (net energy gain over time), the rate of decline is relatively small under a wide range of realistic parameter values and distances; with efficiency (net energy gain over energy cost) and empirically derived energetic costs, the rate of decline is much higher. With lifetime fitness (lifetime food delivery under predation risk), outcomes depend on the ratio of mortality risk during flight and during food collection at the patch. With all currencies, there is a difference between the optimal spatial distribution of solitary and social provisioners, with a larger proportion of social provisioners being farther from the central place. The optimal distribution of solitary provisioners in a two dimensional field of uniformly distributed food such as a flowering meadow is such that the density of solitary provisioners (number per unit area) declines monotonically with distance, and provisioner number peaks at half the maximum area used.},

We analyzed data from previous experiments to determine how recent foraging experience by bumble bees affects their flight distances to subsequent flowers. A single visit to a flower was sufficient to affect the flight distance to the next flower. However, longer sequences of two or three visits had an additional effect on the subsequent flight distance of individual foragers. This suggests that bumble bees can integrate information from at least three flowers for making a subsequent foraging decision. The existence of memory for floral characteristics at least at this scale may have significance for floral selection in natural environments.},

The first two of these processes, landscape complementation and landscape supplementation, occur when individuals move between patches in the landscape to make use of non-substitutable and substitutable resources, respectively. The third process, source-sink dynamics, describes the consequences of having different individuals in the same population occupy habitat patches of different qualities. The fourth process, the neighborhood effect, describes how landscape effects can be amplified when the critical resources are in the landscape immediately surrounding a given patch. Definition of these landscape features and general processes will allow a better synthesis of how landscape variation affects populations and communities.},

  abstract  = {Pollination networks are representations of all interactions between co-existing plants and their flower visiting animals at a given site. Although the study of networks has become a distinct sub-discipline in pollination biology, few studies have attempted to quantify spatio-temporal variation in species composition and structure of networks. We here investigate patterns of year-to-year change in pollination networks from six different sites spanning a large latitudinal gradient. We quantified level of species persistence and interactions among years, and examined year-to-year variation of network structural parameters in relation to latitude and sampling effort. In addition, we tested for correlations between annual variation in network parameters and short and long-term climate change variables. Numbers of plant and animal species and interactions were roughly constant from one year to another at all sites. However, composition of species and interactions changed from one year to another. Turnover was particularly high for flower visitors and interactions. On the other hand, network structural parameters (connectance, nestedness, modularity and centralization) remained remarkably constant between years, regardless of network size and latitude. Inter-annual variation of network parameters was not related to short or long term variation in climate variables (mean annual temperature and annual precipitation). We thus conclude that pollination networks are highly dynamic and variable in composition of species and interactions among years. However, general patterns of network structure remain constant, indicating that species may be replaced by topologically similar species. These results suggest that pollination networks are to some extent robust against factors affecting species occurrences.},

in developing the full yield potential of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). In order to evaluate the yield achieved by
B. napus cv. Artus pollinated by A. mellifera testing was carried out in the district of Freire, La Araucania Region,
Chile. This consisted in isolating or excluding rapeseed plants from pollinators with exclusion cages. Treatments
applied were total exclusion (T1), partial exclusion (T2) and free pollination (T0) with a density of 6.5 hives ha-1,
in order to determine the following yield components traits: grains per silique, siliques per plant, 1000 grain weight
and yield. The experimental design used was randomized complete blocks with three treatments and three replicates.
Results obtained show that the parameter least affected by bee intervention was the grains per silique variable. In
contrast, siliques per plant and 1000 grain weight parameters presented significant differences, contributing to a
yield greater than 5 t ha-1; which represented a figure 50.34% higher than in the treatment without bees. It may be
concluded that the inclusion of bees in crops is fully justified as a production tool.},

Theory shows a climatic limit to this equilibrium above which it is hypothesized that ecological pressure is toward maximization of biomass productivity. It is further hypothesized that natural soil-vegetation systems will develop gradually and synergistically, through vegetation-induced changes in soil structure, toward a set of hydraulic soil properties for which the minimum stress canopy density of a given species is maximum in a given climate. Using these hypotheses, only the soil effective porosity need be known to determine the optimum soil and vegetation parameters in a given climate.},

  abstract  = {This study experimentally examines the relationship between colony state and the behaviour of individual pollen and nectar foragers in the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. In the first experiment we test the prediction that individual pollen foragers from colonies with higher brood quantities should exhibit a greater work effort for pollen resources than individual pollen foragers from colonies with low brood quantities. Eight colonies were assigned into two treatment groups; HIGH brood colonies were manipulated to contain 9600+/-480 cm2 brood area; LOW brood colonies were manipulated to contain 1600+/-80 cm2 brood area. We measured colony brood levels over the course of the experiment and collected individual pollen loads from returning pollen foragers. We found that, while colonies remained significantly different in brood levels, individual pollen foragers from HIGH brood colonies collected larger loads than individuals from LOW brood colonies. In the second experiment we investigated the influence of colony size on the behaviour of individual nectar foragers. We assigned eight colonies to two treatment groups; LARGE colonies were manipulated to contain 35000+/-1700 adult workers with 3500+/-175 cm2 brood area, and SMALL colonies were manipulated to contain 10000+/-500 adult workers with 1000+/-50 cm2 brood area. We observed foraging trips of individually marked workers and found that individuals from LARGE colonies made longer foraging trips than those from SMALL colonies (LARGE: 1666.7+/-126.4 seconds, SMALL: 1210.8+/-157.6 seconds), and collected larger nectar loads (LARGE: 19.2+/-1.0 uL, SMALL: 14.6+/-0.8 uL). These results indicate that individual nectar foragers from LARGE colonies tend to work harder than individuals from SMALL colonies. Both experiments indicate that the values of nectar and pollen resources to a colony change depend on colony state, and that individual foragers modify their behaviour accordingly.},

While empirical evidence for inbreeding depression is vastly greater than that for outbreeding depression, the available data suggest that risks of outbreeding, particularly in the second generation, are on par with the risks of inbreeding. Predicting the relative risks in any particular situation is complicated by variation among taxa, characters being measured, level of divergence between hybridizing populations, mating history, environmental conditions and the potential for inbreeding and outbreeding effects to be occurring simultaneously. Further work on consequences of interpopulation hybridization is sorely needed with particular emphasis on the taxonomic scope, the duration of fitness problems and the joint effects of inbreeding and outbreeding. Meanwhile, managers can minimize the risks of both inbreeding and outbreeding by using intentional hybridization only for populations clearly suffering from inbreeding depression, maximizing the genetic and adaptive similarity between populations, and testing the effects of hybridization for at least two generations whenever possible.},

  abstract  = {Fruit cultivation highly depends on insect pollination for fruit development. Yet, fruit cultivation as an intensive land use can possibly alter the diversity of pollinator communities and the corresponding pollination service. In this study we investigate how intensive fruit cultivation influences both pollinator diversity and fruit set in sweet cherry orchards in Flanders, Belgium. Negative relations were detected between intensive fruit cultivation within 250 m around the orchards and both pollinator species richness and wild pollinator abundance. Honeybee abundance on cherry blossom was positively related with intensive fruit cultivation within 1000 m. Sweet cherry fruit set decreased with increasing intensive fruit cultivation within 250 m and 1000 m around the orchards. These findings suggest that intensive land use such as intensive fruit cultivation can undermine the pollination service of wild pollinators. In addition, the loss of this pollination service was not compensated by honeybees. In these intensive agricultural landscapes the production of sweet cherry is below the optimum, inducing a clear yield gap. In order to gain the full benefit of intensive agriculture, the pollination service needs to be optimised. Landscape-scale measures need to be taken, such as conservation of semi-natural habitat to improve nesting and flowering resources.},

Muscidae and Empididae were more abundant and generalised than other dipteran families visiting flowers in the arctic, their proportions of the total Diptera fauna increase with latitude and they are the most widespread families of flower-visiting insects in the arciic. Several Muscidae species are typical to alpine habitats in the arctic-subarctic zone. These species have special pollen feeding behaviour and an elongated proboscis, which improves access to closed flowers.

We examine the potential consequences of climate change on the geographical distribution of five native bee species and estimate the possible effects of bee distribution shifts on tomato crops in Brazil. Ensemble forecasting was implemented through five algorithms in two carbon emission scenarios to predict range shifts for five tomato-visiting bee species for the year 2100. We then calculated the total tomato crop area in the cells with at least 50% bee suitability, for each bee species, in each scenario. Results showed that all species will undergo a reduction in suitable areas in both scenarios. Bombus morio had the greatest area reduction in 2100 under the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios: near 38% and 71%, respectively. Centris tarsata had the smaller area reduction under the same scenarios: 8.5% and 19.5% respectively. The high agreement between tomato crops and bee distribution observed in the present will also be reduced in both scenarios for all species, especially in the pessimistic scenario. B. morio had the highest reduction in range due to habitat suitability and will be restricted to some parts of southeastern and southern Brazil. Over 60% of the tomato crop area presently within the distribution of B. morio will become climatically unsuitable in the pessimistic emission scenario. This study indicates that the predicted climate change may negatively impact several species associated with tomato crops in Brazil by the year 2100. This is troubling, as it could result in tomato production losses, which would bring economic and environmental losses to the tomato-producing regions with implications for pollinator conservation.},

no studies have actually tested this claim. Here, we combined data on crop
pollination requirements, food nutrient densities, and actual human diets to predict
the effects of pollinator losses on the risk of nutrient deficiency. In four developing
countries and across five nutrients, we found that 0 to 56% of populations would
become newly at risk if pollinators were removed. Increases in risk were most
pronounced for vitamin A in populations with moderate levels of total nutrient intake.
Overall, the effects of pollinator decline varied widely among populations and
nutrients. We conclude that the importance of pollinators to human nutrition
depends critically on the composition of local diets, and cannot be reliably predicted
from global commodity analyses. We identify conditions under which severe health
effects of pollinator loss are most likely to occur.},

developmental transitions such as seed germination, induction of flowering,
leaf senescence and shedding of senescent organs. Auxin response factors
(ARFs) are transcription factors that mediate responses to the plant hormone
auxin. We have examined Arabidopsis lines carrying T-DNA insertions
in AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR1 (ARF1) and ARF2 genes. We
found that ARF2 promotes transitions between multiple stages of
Arabidopsis development. arf2 mutant plants exhibited delays
in several processes related to plant aging, including initiation of
flowering, rosette leaf senescence, floral organ abscission and silique
ripening. ARF2 expression was induced in senescing leaves. ARF2
regulated leaf senescence and floral organ abscission independently of the
ethylene and cytokinin response pathways. arf1 mutations enhanced
many arf2 phenotypes, indicating that ARF1 acts in a
partially redundant manner with ARF2. However, unlike arf2
mutations, an arf1 mutation increased transcription of
Aux/IAA genes in Arabidopsis flowers, supporting previous biochemical

genes, NPH4/ARF7 and ARF19, were also induced by senescence,

  abstract  = {Understanding the relative contributions of wild and managed pollinators, and the functional contributions made by a diverse pollinator community, is essential to the maintenance of yields in the 75% of our crops that benefit from insect pollination. We describe a field study and pollinator exclusion experiments conducted on two soft-fruit crops in a system with both wild and managed pollinators. We test whether fruit quality and quantity is limited by pollination, and whether different pollinating insects respond differently to varying weather conditions. Both strawberries and raspberries produced fewer marketable fruits when insects were excluded, demonstrating dependence on insect pollinators. Raspberries had a short flowering season which coincided with peak abundance of bees, and attracted many bees per flower. In contrast, strawberries had a much longer flowering season and appeared to be much less attractive to pollinators, so that ensuring adequate pollination is likely to be more challenging. The proportion of high-quality strawberries was positively related to pollinator abundance, suggesting that yield was limited by inadequate pollination on some farms. The relative abundance of different pollinator taxa visiting strawberries changed markedly through the season, demonstrating seasonal complementarity. Insect visitors responded differently to changing weather conditions suggesting that diversity can reduce the risk of pollination service shortfalls. For example, flies visited the crop flowers in poor weather and at the end of the flowering season when other pollinators were scarce, and so may provide a unique functional contribution. Understanding how differences between pollinator groups can enhance pollination services to crops strengthens the case for multiple species management. We provide evidence for the link between increased diversity and function in real crop systems, highlighting the risks of replacing all pollinators with managed alternatives.},

Plant evolutionary biologists{\textquoteright} view of gene flow and hybridization has undergone a revolution. Twenty{\textendash}five years ago, both were considered rare and largely inconsequential. Now gene flow and hybridization are known to be idiosyncratic, varying with the specific populations involved. Gene flow typically occurs at evolutionarily significant rates and at significant distances. Spontaneous hybridization occasionally has important applied consequences, such as stimulating the evolution of more aggressive invasives and increasing the extinction risk for rare species. The same problems have occurred for spontaneous hybridization between crops and their wild relatives. These new data have implications for transgenic crops: (i) for most crops, gene flow can act to introduce engineered genes into wild populations; (ii) depending on the specific engineered gene(s) and populations involved, gene flow may have the same negative impacts as those observed for traditionally improved crops; (iii) gene flow{\textquoteright}s idiosyncratic nature may frustrate management and monitoring attempts; and (iv) intercrop transgene flow, although rarely discussed, is equally worthy of study.

  Abstract                 = {The absence of gene flow, genetic isolation, is frequently emphasized in conservation genetics. However, the presence of gene flow can play an equally important role in determining the genetic fate of populations. Here, I first review what is known of patterns of gene flow by pollen. Gene flow by pollen is often substantial among plant populations. I next review the expectations for gene flow patterns in the small populations typical of endangered species. Then, I consider what role gene flow can play in plant conservation genetics. Depending on the specific situation, such gene flow could be either beneficial or detrimental. Geographically disjunct populations might not always be as reproductively isolated as previously thought, and thereby less vulnerable to detrimental drift-based processes. On the other hand, conspecific or heterospecific hybridization may lead to extinction by outbreeding depression or genetic assimilation. Also, the field release of transgenic plants may lead to the escape of engineered genes by crop-wild plant hybridization. Such "genetic pollution" could have profound effects on the fitness of wild species with the potential for disrupting natural communities. Gene flow can be an important force in plant conservation genetics, and its potential role should be considered in any plant conservation management program.},

Intersite comparisons indicated an association between the degree of summer warming and change in vascular plant abundance, with shrubs, forbs and rushes increasing with warming. However, the association was dependent on the climate zone, the moisture regime and the presence of permafrost. Our data provide plot-scale evidence linking changes in vascular plant abundance to local summer warming in widely dispersed tundra locations across the globe.},

In situ warming experiments accelerate climate change on a small scale to forecast responses of local plant communities. Limitations of this approach include the apparent site-specificity of results and uncertainty about the power of short-term studies to anticipate longer term change. We address these issues with a synthesis of 61 experimental warming studies, of up to 20 years duration, in tundra sites worldwide. The response of plant groups to warming often differed with ambient summer temperature, soil moisture and experimental duration. Shrubs increased with warming only where ambient temperature was high, whereas graminoids increased primarily in the coldest study sites. Linear increases in effect size over time were frequently observed. There was little indication of saturating or accelerating effects, as would be predicted if negative or positive vegetation feedbacks were common. These results indicate that tundra vegetation exhibits strong regional variation in response to warming, and that in vulnerable regions, cumulative effects of long-term warming on tundra vegetation - and associated ecosystem consequences - have the potential to be much greater than we have observed to date.},

Reciprocal hand pollination experiments were performed to study these mechanisms in two species of Louisiana iris: Iris brevicaulis and I. fulva. Relative pollen-tube growth rates changed significantly through time, with I. fulva tubes increasingly outperforming I. brevicaulis tubes in both conspecific and heterospecific styles. However, this pattern of change in relative performance was a poor predictor of siring success: the majority of seeds sired by both maternal species was conspecific rather than hybrid. Experimental crosses and field studies show consistent asymmetric hybridization in Louisiana irises, with I. fulva being a more successful father and a more selective mother than both I. brevicaulis and a third species, I. hexagona. The cause of this pattern is not yet clear, but the pattern itself is unusual. Typically, short-styled species tend to be less successful in reciprocal crosses than long-styled relatives, but I. fulva has shorter styles than either I. brevicaulis or I. hexagona. The effects of pollen-tube competition, differential fertilization, and selective abortion in causing this pattern of asymmetric hybridization is discussed.},

This article reviews different forms of pollen tube transmitting tracts within the style as well as possibilities for bridging the gap from the transmitting tissue to the ovule. The pollen tube transmitting tissue is the place of possible pollen tube competition. Often the number of pollen grains deposited onto the stigma or stigmata of a flower exceeds the number of ovules in the ovary of the pollinated flower. In the styles of most taxa investigated, a reduction in number of the pollen tubes occurs from the stigma to the ovary (pollen tube attrition): the pollen tubes compete for entry into the embryo sac of the ovules within the ovary. A prediction of the extent of pollen tube competition can be partially equated to the P-S/O ratio. This ratio relates the total number of pollen grains (P) deposited onto the stigmata (S) at the end of the female phase of anthesis (stigma receptivity) to the number of ovules (O) present in the ovary. Some quantitative data on pollen load on the stigma or stigmata and resulting pollen tube competition will be demonstrated especially in the choricarpous gynoecium of Geum rivale (Rosaceae) and in the coenocarpous gynoecium of Cichorium intybus (Asteraceae). Data from this study are compared with data of other taxa obtained from the literature.},

High fruit set and low seed abortion rate, as in P. hirsuta, is common in arctic plants in late-thawing habitats and represents a case of extreme adversity selection rather than an indication of a ruderal life-history strategy. Pedicularis lapponica, on the other hand, is a typical K-strategist (or stress-tolerator) requiring a longer period of growth for optimal reproduction. Occurring at both low and high altitudes in the area, P. lapponica tends to increase in self-compatibility with altitude, which is interpreted as an adaptation to lower pollinator visitation frequency in arctic environments. The variation in length of the protruding part of the style in P. lapponica is shown to be correlated with exposure to light. Predispersal seed predation is severe in P. lapponica at low altitudes, where the capsules are attacked by fly and moth larvae. At high altitudes, a minor proportion of the capsules of P. lapponica experience predation and only from flies, while P. hirsuta is completely unpredated.},

  abstract            = {Despite a long tradition in plant ecology of studies of patch dynamics, recent developments of models for large scale dynamics in source-sink and metapopulations have largely focused on animals. In contrast to mobile unitary animals, many plants resist extinction, even under conditions where only a part of the life cycle can be maintained. This model of remnant population dynamics adds to the two commonly recognized source-sink and metapopulations dynamics. A review of the literature suggests that all three types of dynamics are common in plants. Regional dynamics are related to life-cycle characteristics determining dispersal ability and longevity of life cycle stages. Short-lived or highly habitat specialized plants with good dispersal tend to build up metapopulations, i.e. systems of local populations and non-occupied but potentially suitable sites, interconnected with dispersal, and in a continuous flux of local colonization and extinction. At the other extreme, long-lived plants with clonal propagation, or plants with extensive seed banks, tend to build up remnant population systems, in which many local populations persist over periods long enough to bridge unfavourable phases of successional development, intervening periods of favourable conditions. Source-sink populations are a special case of metapopulations, in the sense that they comprise both persistent refuge populations and ephemeral populations maintained by dispersal. It is suggested that a concept of local population inertia in remnant population systems, scales to higher level phenomena of vegetation inertia, and to community stabilization (through enhanced recovery after perturbations). Such an inertia may contribute to explain cases of exceptionally high species diversity, and lack of pronounced mass extinctions of plants in the fossil record.},

geographic range (GR) (large vs. small), habitat specificity (HS) (specialist vs. generalist),
and local abundance (LA) (dense vs. sparse). In the wider ecology literature, research on
the association between plant species distributions and life history traits has mainly
focused on a single axis such as GR. However, the internal structure of species ranges is
widely recognized as important. In order to determine if identifying different types of rarity
leads to alternative conclusions regarding the causes and consequences of rarity, we created
a dataset linking the seven types of rarity matrix and to reproductive ecology traits.
We found associations between the axes and these traits in a dataset of 101 rare plant
species culled from 27 papers. Significant traits included mating system and seed dispersal
mechanism. Species with small GR are more likely to have ballistic or wind dispersal than
biotically-mediated dispersal (abiotic:biotic ratio 3:1). Habitat specialist species with small
GRs are more likely to have outcrossing mating systems compared to habitat specialists of
large GR (16:1). These results show that, within rare species, the structure of rarity is
important (e.g. habitat specialization is different from small GR) and should be identified
when determining basic mechanisms of plant distribution and abundance.},

  abstract  = {Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a risk to human welfare,both directly and indirectly, by affecting managed livestock and wildlife that provide valuable resources and ecosystem services, such as the pollination of crops2. Honeybees (Apis mellifera), the prevailing managed insect crop pollinator, suffer froma range of emerging and exotic high-impact pathogens3,4, and population maintenance requires active management by beekeepers to control them. Wild pollinators such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are in global decline5,6, one cause of which may be pathogen spillover from managed pollinators like honeybees7,8 or commercial colonies of bumblebees9. Here we use a combination of infection experiments and landscapescale
field data to show that honeybee EIDs are indeed widespread infectious agents within the pollinator assemblage. The prevalence of deformed wing virus (DWV) and the exotic parasite Nosema
ceranae in honeybees and bumblebees is linked; as honeybees have higherDWVprevalence, and sympatric bumblebees and honeybees are infected by the same DWV strains, Apis is the likely source of at least one major EID in wild pollinators. Lessons learned from vertebrates10,11 highlight the need for increased pathogen control in managed bee species to maintain wild  pollinators, as declines in native pollinators may be caused by interspecies pathogen transmission originating from managed pollinators.},

  abstract            = {The literature on effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term "fragmentation" should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.},

  abstract            = {I reviewed and reconciled predictions of four models on the effect of habitat fragmentation on the population extinction threshold, and I compared these predictions to results from empirical studies. All four models predict that habitat fragmentation can, under some conditions, increase the extinction threshold such that, in more fragmented landscapes, more habitat is required for population persistence. However, empirical studies have shown both positive and negative effects of habitat fragmentation on population abundance and distribution with about equal frequency, suggesting that the models lack some important process(es). The two colonization-extinction (CE) models predict that fragmentation can increase the extinction threshold by up to 60-80%; i.e., the amount of habitat required for persistence can shift from <5% of the landscape to >80% of the landscape, with a shift from completely clumped to completely fragmented habitat. The other two models (birth-immigration-death -emigration, or BIDE models) predict much smaller potential effects of fragmentation on the extinction threshold, of no more than a 10-20% shift in the amount of habitat required for persistence. This difference has important implications for conservation. If fragmentation can have a large effect on the extinction threshold, then alteration of habitat pattern (independent of habitat amount) can be an effective tool for conservation. On the other hand, if the effects of fragmentation on the extinction threshold are small, then this is a limited option. I suggest that the difference in model predictions results from differences in the mechanisms by which the models produce the extinction threshold. In the CE models, the threshold occurs by an assumed reduction in colonization rate with decreasing habitat amount. In the BIDE models, loss of habitat is assumed to increase the proportion of the population that spends time in the matrix, where reproduction is not possible and the mortality rate is assumed to be higher (than in breeding habitat). Habitat loss therefore decreases the overall reproduction rate and increases the overall mortality rate on the landscape. I hypothesize that this imposes a constraint on the potential for habitat fragmentation to mitigate effects of habitat loss in BIDE models. To date, empirical studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation suggest that habitat loss has a much larger effect than habitat fragmentation on the distribution and abundance of birds, supporting the BIDE model prediction, at least for this taxon.},

One of these principles is that how habitats are arranged in space can mitigate the risks of species extinctions from habitat loss. I tested this by estimating the relative importance of habitat loss and habitat spatial pattern (fragmentation) on population extinction, using a simple, spatially explicit simulation model. Results indicate that the effects of habitat loss far outweight the effects of habitat fragmentation. I therefore suggest that, in fact, details of how habitats are arranged cannot usually mitigate the risks of habitat loss. Conservation efforts should be aimed foremost at stopping habitat loss and at habitat restoration.},

  abstract  = {Simple rules for landscape management seem elusive because different species and species groups are associated with different land cover types; a change in landscape structure that increases diversity of one group may reduce diversity of another. On the other hand, if simple landscape-biodiversity relationships do exist despite this complexity, they would have great practical benefit to conservation management. With these considerations in mind, we tested for consistent relationships between landscape heterogeneity and biodiversity in farmland (the cropped areas in agricultural landscapes), with a view to developing simple rules for landscape management that could increase biodiversity within farmland. Our measures of farmland heterogeneity were crop diversity and mean crop field size, where increases in crop diversity and/or decreases in mean field size represent increasing landscape heterogeneity. We sampled the abundance, and alpha, gamma and beta diversity of birds, plants, butterflies, syrphids, bees, carabids and spiders, in crop fields within each of 93 1km×1km agricultural landscapes. The landscapes were selected to represent three gradients in landscape composition and heterogeneity: proportion of the landscape in crop, mean crop field size and Shannon crop type diversity of the farmland. We found that mean crop field size had the strongest overall effect on biodiversity measures in crop fields, and this effect was consistently negative. Based on our results we suggest that, if biodiversity conservation in crop fields is a priority, policies and guidelines aimed at reducing crop field sizes should be considered.},

  abstract  = {The European honeybee, Apis mellifera, is an important pollinator of agricultural crops. Since 2006, when unexpectedly high colony losses were first reported, articles have proliferated in the popular press suggesting a range of possible causes and raising alarm over the general decline of bees. Suggested causes include pesticides, genetically modified crops, habitat fragmentation, and introduced diseases and parasites. Scientists have concluded that multiple factors in various combinations-including mites, fungi, viruses, and pesticides, as well as other factors such as reduction in forage, poor nutrition, and queen failure-are the most probable cause of elevated colony loss rates. Investigators and regulators continue to focus on the possible role that insecticides, particularly the neonicotinoids, may play in honeybee health. Neonicotinoid insecticides are insect neurotoxicants with desirable features such as broad-spectrum activity, low application rates, low mammalian toxicity, upward systemic movement in plants, and versatile application methods. Their distribution throughout the plant, including pollen, nectar, and guttation fluids, poses particular concern for exposure to pollinators. The authors describe how neonicotinoids interact with the nervous system of honeybees and affect individual honeybees in laboratory situations. Because honeybees are social insects, colony effects in semifield and field studies are discussed. The authors conclude with a review of current and proposed guidance in the United States and Europe for assessing the risks of pesticides to honeybees.},

  abstract  = {Habitat loss and fragmentation lead to changes in species richness and composition which may affect ecosystem services. Yet, few studies distinguish between the effects of habitat loss and isolation, or how multiple ecosystem services may be affected simultaneously. We investigated the effects of variation in cover of woody and open semi-natural habitats and isolation from forest on the relative functioning of pollination, seed predation and insect scavenging in agricultural landscapes. We established 30 sites in grassland locations in the Swiss plateau around Berne. The sites varied independently in their isolation from forest edges, in the percentage of woody habitats and in the percentage of open seminatural habitats in the surrounding landscape (500 m radius). We experimentally exposed primroses, sunflower seeds and cricket corpses during spring 2008. None of the three studied services was affected by variation in woody or open semi-natural habitat cover. However, the proportion of flowers setting seed was significantly reduced by isolation from forest. Further, seed predation and insect scavenging were significantly lower at isolated sites than at sites connected to woody habitat. This pattern was particularly pronounced for seeds and insect corpses that were enclosed by wire netting and thus inaccessible to vertebrates. Thus, all three studied services responded quite similarly to the landscape context. The observed small-scale determination of seed set, seed predation and insect scavenging contrasts with larger-scale determination of pollination and insect pest control found in other studies.},

Most regression, correlation, and contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods, assume that the points are drawn independently from a common distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny, they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these conditions, the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among species, con- trasts that are statistically independent and can be used in regression or correlation studies. The considerable barriers to making practical use of this technique have been discussed},

The pace and nature of this change is largely unstudied, especially for the most diverse elements of terrestrial communities - the arthropods - here we have only limited knowledge concerning the taxonomy and the ecology of these groups. Because Arctic ecosystems have already experienced significant increases in temperature over the past half century, shifts in community structure may already be in progress. Here we utilise collections of a particularly hyperdiverse insect group - parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera; Braconidae; Microgastrinae) - at Churchill, Manitoba, Canada in the early and mid-twentieth century to compare the composition of the contemporary community to that present 50-70 years ago. Morphological and DNA barcoding results revealed the presence of 79 species of microgastrine wasps in collections from Churchill, but we estimate that 20% of the local fauna awaits detection. Species composition and diversity between the two time periods differ significantly; species that were most common in historic collections were not found in contemporary collections and vice versa. Using barcodes we compared these collections to others from across North America; contemporary Churchill species are most affiliated with more south-western collections, while historic collections were more affiliated with eastern collections. The past five decades has clearly seen a dramatic change of species composition within the area studied coincident with rising temperature.</p>},

  abstract  = {Western harvester ants, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, preferentially utilize low vegetational cover pathways, Energetic costs for foraging ants were less than 0.1% of caloric rewards of harvested seeds, suggesting that reduction of energetic cost is not a major benefit of this preference. Walking speed was significantly faster on lower cover routes, increasing net return rates from equidistant artificial food sources. Undisturbed foragers on low cover routes traveled farther, increasing their total foraging area without increasing foraging time. These results suggest that in animals with low costs of locomotion relative to energetic rewards, time costs are more important than direct energetic costs in influencing foraging decisions. In baited experiments with equidistant food sources, preferential use of low cover routes resulted in a large increase in net energetic gain rate, but only a slight increase in energetic efficiency. Under natural conditions, net energetic gain rates were constant for foragers using low and high vegetational cover routes, but foragers using low cover paths had lower efficiencies. This suggests that net energetic gain rate is a more important currency than energetic efficiency for foraging harvester ants.},

To address this problem, we examined interactions between individual foraging behavior and pollen storage levels in the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. Colonies responded to low pollen storage conditions by increasing pollen intake rates 54% relative to high pollen storage conditions, demonstrating a direct relationship between pollen storage levels and foraging effort. Approximately 80% of the difference in pollen intake rates was accounted for by variation in individual foraging effort, via changes in foraging activity and individual pollen load size. An additional 20% resulted from changes in the proportion of the foraging population collecting pollen. Under both high and low pollen storage treatments, colonies returned pollen storage levels to pre-experimental levels within 16 days, suggesting that honey bees regulate pollen storage levels around a homeostatic set point. We also found a direct relationship between pollen storage levels and colony brood production, demonstrating the potential for cumulative changes in individual foraging decisions to affect colony fitness.},

  abstract  = {Terrestrial net primary production (NPP) is sensitive to a number of controls, including aspects of climate, topography, soils, plant and microbial characteristics, disturbance, and anthropogenic impacts. Yet, at least at the global scale, models based on very different types and numbers of parameters yield similar results. Part of the reason for this is that the major \{NPP\} controls influence each other, resulting, under current conditions, in broad correlations among controls. \{NPP\} models that include richer suites of controlling parameters should be more sensitive to conditions that disrupt the broad correlations, but the current paucity of global data limits the power of complex models. Improved data sets will facilitate applications of complex models, but many of the critical data are very difficult to produce, especially for applications dealing with the past or future. It may be possible to overcome some of the challenges of data availability through increased understanding and modeling of ecological processes that adjust plant physiology and architecture in relation to resources. The \{CASA\} (Carnegie, Stanford, Ames Approach) model introduced by Potter et al. (1993) and expanded here uses a combination of ecological principles, satellite data, and surface data to predict terrestrial \{NPP\} on a monthly time step. \{CASA\} calculates \{NPP\} as a product of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, APAR, and an efficiency of radiation use, E. The underlying postulate is that some of the limitations on \{NPP\} appear in each. \{CASA\} estimates annual terrestrial \{NPP\} to be 48 Pg and the maximum efficiency of \{PAR\} utilization (E*) to be 0.39 g C MJ-1 PAR. Spatial and temporal variation in \{APAR\} is more than fivefold greater than variation in E.},

  abstract  = {Aim: We surveyed the empirical literature to determine how well six diversity hypotheses account for spatial patterns in species richness across varying scales of grain and extent.
Location: Worldwide.
Methods: We identified 393 analyses (‘cases’) in 297 publications meeting our criteria. These criteria included the requirement that more than one diversity hypothesis was tested for its relationship with species richness. We grouped variables representing the hypotheses into the following ‘correlate types’: climate/productivity, environmental heterogeneity, edaphics/nutrients, area, biotic interactions and dispersal/history (colonization limitation or other historical or evolutionary effect). For each case we determined the ‘primary’ variable: the one most strongly correlated with taxon richness. We defined ‘primacy’ as the proportion of cases in which each correlate type was represented by the primary variable, relative to the number of times it was studied. We tested for differences in both primacy and mean coefficient of determination of the primary variable between the hypotheses and between categories of five grouping variables: grain, extent, taxon (animal vs. plant), habitat medium (land vs. water) and insularity (insular vs. connected).
Results: Climate/productivity had the highest overall primacy, and environmental heterogeneity and dispersal/history had the lowest. Primacy of climate/productivity was much higher in large-grain and large-extent studies than at smaller scales. It was also higher on land than in water, and much higher in connected systems than in insular ones. For other hypotheses, differences were less pronounced. Throughout, studies on plants and animals showed similar patterns. Coefficients of determination of the primary variables differed little between hypotheses and across the grouping variables, the strongest effects being low means in the smallest grain class and for edaphics/nutrients variables, and a higher mean for water than for land in connected systems but vice versa in insular systems. We highlight areas of data deficiency.
Main conclusions: Our results support the notion that climate and productivity play an important role in determining species richness at large scales, particularly for non-insular, terrestrial habitats. At smaller extents and grain sizes, the primacy of the different types of correlates appears to differ little from null expectation. In our analysis, dispersal/history is rarely the best correlate of species richness, but this may reflect the difficulty of incorporating historical factors into regression models, and the collinearity between past and current climates. Our findings are consistent with the view that climate determines the capacity for species richness. However, its influence is less evident at smaller spatial scales, probably because (1) studies small in extent tend to sample little climatic range, and (2) at large grains some other influences on richness tend to vary mainly within the sampling unit.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Regional declines in insect pollinators have raised concerns about crop pollination. Many pollinator studies use visitation rate (pollinators/time) as a proxy for the quality of crop pollination. Visitation rate estimates are based on observation durations that vary significantly between studies. How observation duration relates to the accuracy of the visitation rate estimate is, however, unknown. We studied this relationship using six day-long observations (06:00 h–19:00 h) in leek-seed production fields (totalling 78 h). We analysed beyond which point in time observing longer did not significantly improve the accuracy of the visitation rate estimate (minimum observation duration). We furthermore explored the relationship between the minimum observation duration and visitation rate, time of day and temperature. We found that the minimum observation duration (mean ± SD: 24 ± 11.9 min) was significantly related to visitation rate, where the observation time required to obtain accurate estimates decreased with increasing visitation rate. Minimum observation duration varied greatly between days and between fields but not within days. Within days, the visitation rates differed significantly only between the hour-intervals 06:00 h–07:00 h (lowest visitation rate) and 09:00 h–11:00 h (highest rate). Minimum observation duration decreased up to around 22 °C beyond which it remained fairly stable. Surprisingly, even after three day-long observations on the same plant we found new pollinator species visiting the flowers, suggesting that species-richness estimates based on plant observations alone probably underestimate true species richness. Because especially between-day variation in visitation rate on single plants can be large, reliable estimates of the pollinator visitation rate during the plant’s flowering time require observations on multiple days. Standardising the number of pollinators rather than the time to observe (standardised pollinator timing approach: time to n-pollinator visits) may provide more consistent accurate assessments of visitation rate, especially for studies that use gradients in visitation rates to examine the contribution of pollinators to crop pollination.},

It is shown that in a large collection of Lepidoptera captured in Malaya the frequency of the number of species represented by different numbers of individuals fitted somewhat closely to a hyperbola type of curve, so long as only the rarer species were considered. The data for the commoner species was not so strictly `randomized', but the whole series could be closely fitted by a series of the logarithmic type as described by Fisher in Part 3. Other data for random collections of insects in the field were also shown to fit fairly well to this series. Part 2. Extensive data on the capture of about 1500 Macrolepidoptera of about 240 species in a light-trap at Harpenden is analysed in relation to Fisher's mathematical theory and is shown to fit extremely closely to the calculations. The calculations are applied first to the frequency of occurrence of species represented by different numbers of individuals--and secondly to the number of species in samples of different sizes from the same population. The parameter ` alpha ', which it is suggested should be called the `index of diversity', is shown to have a regular seasonal change in the case of the Macrolepidoptera in the trap. In addition, samples from two traps which overlooked somewhat different vegetation are shown to have ` alpha ' values which are significantly different. It is shown that, provided the samples are not small, ` alpha ' is the increase in the number of species obtained by increasing the size of a sample by e (2.718). A diagram is given (Fig. 8) from which any one of the values, total number of species, total number of individuals and index of diversity (alpha), can be obtained approximately if the other two are known. The standard error of alpha is also indicated on the same diagram. Part 3. A theoretical distribution is developed which appears to be suitable for the frequencies with which different species occur in a random collection, in the common case in which many species are so rare that their chance of inclusion is small. The relationships of the new distribution with the negative binomial and the Poisson series are established. Numerical processes are exhibited for fitting the series to observations containing given numbers of species and individuals, and for estimating the parameter alpha representing the richness in species of the material sampled; secondly, for calculating the standard error of alpha, and thirdly, for testing whether the series exhibits a significant deviation from the limiting form used. Special tables are presented for facilitating these calculations.},

(2) The optimal home range shape in a patchy environment is elongate rather than circular, with a major to minor axis ratio of about 2:1. This agrees well with observed values. (3) The proportion of the total home range used per foraging bout is positively related to the renewal rate of the environment.

  abstract  = {Climate change can affect plant-pollinator interactions in a variety of ways, but much of the research attention has focused on whether independent shifts in phenology will alter temporal overlap between plants and pollinators. Here I review the research on plant-pollinator mismatch, assessing the potential for observational and experimental approaches to address particular aspects of the problem. Recent, primarily observational studies suggest that phenologies of co-occurring plants and pollinators tend to respond similarly to environmental cues, but that nevertheless, certain pairs of interacting species are showing independent shifts in phenology. Only in a few cases, however, have these independent shifts been shown to affect population vital rates (specifically, seed production by plants) but this largely reflects a lack of research. Compared to the few long-term studies of pollination in natural plant populations, experimental manipulations of phenology have yielded relatively optimistic conclusions about effects of phenological shifts on plant reproduction, and I discuss how issues of scale and frequency-dependence in pollinator behaviour affect the interpretation of these ‘temporal transplant’ experiments. Comparable research on the impacts of mismatch on pollinator populations is so far lacking, but both observational studies and focused experiments have the potential to improve our forecasts of pollinator responses to changing phenologies. Finally, while there is now evidence that plant-pollinator mismatch can affect seed production by plants, it is still unclear whether this phenological impact will be the primary way in which climate change affects plant-pollinator interactions. It would be useful to test the direct effects of changing climate on pollinator population persistence, and to compare the importance of phenological mismatch with other threats to pollination.},

  abstract  = {Warm temperatures are required for insect flight. Consequently, warming could benefit many high-latitude and high-altitude insects by increasing opportunities for foraging or oviposition. However, warming can also alter species interactions, including interactions with natural enemies, making the net effect of rising temperatures on population growth rate difficult to predict. We investigated the temperature-dependence of nesting activity and lifetime reproductive output over 3 yr in subalpine populations of a pollen-specialist bee, Osmia iridis. Rates of nest provisioning increased with ambient temperatures and with availability of floral resources, as expected. However, warmer conditions did not increase lifetime reproductive output. Lifetime offspring production was best explained by rates of brood parasitism (by the wasp Sapyga), which increased with temperature. Direct observations of bee and parasite activity suggest that although activity of both species is favored by warmer temperatures, bees can be active at lower ambient temperatures, while wasps are active only at higher temperatures. Thus, direct benefits to the bees of warmer temperatures were nullified by indirect costs associated with increased parasite activity. To date, most studies of climate-change effects on pollinators have focused on changing interactions between pollinators and their floral host-plants (i.e., bottom-up processes). Our results suggest that natural enemies (i.e., top-down forces) can play a key role in pollinator population regulation and should not be overlooked in forecasts of pollinator responses to climate change.},

  abstract  = {Land-use change frequently reduces local species diversity. Species losses will often result in loss of trait diversity, with likely consequences for community functioning. However, the converse need not be generally true: management approaches that succeed in retaining species richness could nevertheless fail to maintain trait diversity. We evaluated this possibility using bee communities in a California agroecosystem.We examined among-site patterns in bee species diversity and functional-trait diversity in a landscape composed of a mosaic of semi-natural habitat, organic farms, and conventional farms. We sampled bees from all three habitat types, and compiled a database of life-history (“functional”) traits for each species. Although species richness was higher on organic farms than conventional farms, functional diversity was lower in both farm types than in natural habitat. Nesting location (below-ground vs. above-ground) was the primary trait contributing to differences in functional diversity between farms and natural habitat, reflecting observed differences in availability of nesting substrates among habitat types. Other traits, including phenology and sociality, were also associated with species’ occurrences or dominance in particular site types. These patterns suggest that management practices common to all farms act as environmental filters that cause similarly low functional diversity in their bee communities.
Synthesis and applications. Although our results support the value of organic farming in maintaining abundant and species-rich bee communities, components of bee functional diversity are not well supported in farmed landscapes, regardless of farming practice. Maintenance of natural habitat, and/or the addition of natural-habitat elements to farms, is therefore important for the retention of functionally diverse bee assemblages in agroecosystems.},

By complex, I mean a model that contains terms related by marginality or hierarchy, such as polynomial terms, or main effects and interactions. I call these tables or graphs effect displays. Effect displays are constructed by identifying high-order terms in a generalised linear model. Fitted values under the model are computed for each such term. The lower-order \"relatives\" of a high-order term (e.g., main effects marginal to an interaction) are absorbed into the term, allowing the predictors appearing in the high-order term to range over their values. The values of other predictors are fixed at typical values: for example, a covariate could be fixed at its mean or median, a factor at its proportional distribution in the data, or to equal proportions in its several levels. Variations of effect displays are also described, including representation of terms higher-order to any appearing in the model.},

An ecosystem approach is also the only way to conserve processes and habitats (such as forest canopies, belowground habitats, and hyporheic zones) that, with their constituent species, are poorly known. Continued concern with species is essential, however. Landscape-level issues also need much greater attention. Designing an appropriate system of habitat reserves is one landscape-level concern. Understanding and appropriately manipulating the landscape matrix is at least equal in importance to reserves issues, however, since the matrix itself is important in maintaining diversity, influences the effectiveness of reserves, and controls landscape connectivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate change is occurring more rapidly in the Arctic than elsewhere, and is predicted to have a large impact on biodiversity, since entire cold-adapted ecosystems are likely to disappear. Here, we highlight changes in the insect species richness and community composition of wild bees, butterflies and moths over 60 years in an area situated above the tree limit (Padjelanta National Park) in northern Sweden. Although there were changes in habitat availability, indicated by a significant decrease in the area of a glacier (from 22 km2 in 1898 to 7.5 km2 in 2009), and an increase in the area of birch forest in the National Park, we nevertheless found relatively moderate changes in the insect communities. Indeed, the observed number of species increased from 52 in 1944 to 64 in 2008. Remarkably, the mean number of butterflies and moths per site, but not wild bee species, increased significantly. Among the species that were recorded in both periods, the average altitude of 17 species had shifted downhill, 12 shifted uphill, and the altitude of the remaining 17 had not changed. While alterations in community composition were greater at the highest altitudes, changes in the insect community were smaller than expected, indeed much smaller than those reported from agricultural landscapes in North-West Europe. Interestingly, our results suggest that lower {Alpine} altitudes (600-800 m a.s.l.) have become colonized by southern species, but also that high {Alpine} areas (above 1,000 m a.s.l.) have recently become colonized by high {Alpine} species previously absent from these sites, likely as a result of increasing habitat availability. We conclude that wild bee, butterfly, and moth communities in Arctic areas in northern Sweden are in flux, as a result of climate change and suggest that increased attention must be given to conservation planning in cold areas. In addition, we propose that monitoring programs should be established, because more pronounced climate-driven changes can be expected in the future.},

Bumblebees were less inclined to collect pollen than honeybees. A few honeybees scrabbled over the male flowers for pollen without collecting nectar on some visits, but collected nectar on others and, when they did so, tended also to collect pollen loads more often than bees that had never deliberately sought pollen. 2. Visits in which pollen was collected were most numerous early in the morning and late afternoon, probably in association with its availability. 3. Very few of the visits for nectar were to flowers in the female stage but most nectar-gatherers often stood on the female flowers and so presumably could pollinate them. Nectar-gatherers with pollen visited more florets per head than nectar-gatherers without pollen. 4. Some honeybees visited the extrafloral nectaries in the bracts and upper leaves of the plants, particularly during the afternoon. Bees visiting the extrafloral nectaries rarely visited the florets and never did so during the same trip. 5. These findings are discussed in relation to the pollination of sunflowers.},

  abstract  = {(1) When foraging on Brussels sprout cultivars with small flowers, nectar-gathering bees preferred to visit the inner nectaries which they approached through the mouths of the flowers. More nectar-gatherers alighted on the outside of flowers of cultivars with deeper corolla tubes and larger floral parts, and inserted their tongues between the perianth segments to reach the outer nectaries, probably because they could not reach the inner nectaries. Bees soon learned to rob flowers and the ease with which they did so, increased as a flower became older and its perianth segments spread apart. Most foragers visiting some cultivars were robbers, particularly at the later stages of flowering. However, some cultivars with small flowers were not robbed even when their flowers were old. 
(2) Flowers were less likely to be pollinated by robber bees than by bees that entered them. Robbing can be discouraged by selecting Brussels sprout cultivars with inner nectaries easily reached by bees and also by increasing the proportion of pollen to nectargatherers visiting the crop. 
(3) In cages, bees did not discriminate between different cultivars, but in an open plot of ten cultivars, different bees preferred different cultivars and some showed considerable constancy to their preferred cultivar. Cultivar preferences may sometimes be associated with nectar availability. The implications of this to the production of hybrid seed are discussed.},

The perspective of basically food or habitat limited populations is giving way to a more balanced perspective including varying levels of predation. The heavily descriptive, detailed methods of the traditional naturalist and the modern system analyst are being complimented with models of Hutchinsonian simplicity, where idealized, easily understandable models are offered as an approximation to reality. The analysis of Hairston, Smith, and Slobodkin is presented as the major turning point in this revolution, where some key assumptions about trophic levels and population regulation are first used as a basis for analysis. Modeling by Rosenzweig put these assumptions on solid ground, and introduced a key variable, primary productivity. Fretwell and Oksanen and his colleagues generalized and extended the kind of logic used in these pioneering studies, to provide a theory that could be central to all of ecology. This theory is reviewed in the present study, is extended to include the field of community ecology, and arguments are offered defending the position that this research program, called Food Chain Dynamics, could be regarded as the central theory of ecology, at least as important as the theory of evolution.},

  abstract = {Background The rich literature that characterizes the field of pollination biology has focused largely on animal-pollinated plants. At least 10 % of angiosperms are wind pollinated, and this mode of pollination has evolved on multiple occasions among unrelated lineages, and hence this discrepancy in research interest is surprising. Here, the evolution and functional ecology of pollination and mating in wind-pollinated plants are discussed, a theoretical framework for modelling the selection of wind pollination is outlined, and pollen capture and the occurrence of pollen limitation in diverse wind-pollinated herbs are investigated experimentally.Scope and Conclusions Wind pollination may commonly evolve to provide reproductive assurance when pollinators are scarce. Evidence is presented that pollen limitation in wind-pollinated plants may not be as common as it is in animal-pollinated species. The studies of pollen capture in wind-pollinated herbs demonstrate that pollen transfer efficiency is not substantially lower than in animal-pollinated plants as is often assumed. These findings challenge the explanation that the evolution of few ovules in wind-pollinated flowers is associated with low pollen loads. Floral and inflorescence architecture is crucial to pollination and mating because of the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Evidence is provided for the importance of plant height, floral position, and stamen and stigma characteristics in promoting effective pollen dispersal and capture. Finally, it is proposed that geitonogamous selfing may alleviate pollen limitation in many wind-pollinated plants with unisexual flowers.},

  abstract  = {A numerical process-based model of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics is described and tested. The model, Hybrid v3.0, treats the daily cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and water within the biosphere and between the biosphere and the atmosphere. It combines a mass-balance approach with the capacity to predict the relative dominance of different species or generalised plant types (such as evergreen needleleaved trees, cold deciduous broadleaved trees, and \{C3\} grasses). The growth of individual trees is simulated on an annual timestep, and the growth of a grass layer is simulated on a daily timestep. The exchange of carbon, nitrogen, and water with the atmosphere and the soil is simulated on a daily timestep (except the flux of tree litter to the soil, which occurs annually). Individual trees and the grass layer compete with each other for light, water, and nitrogen within a ‘plot’. Larger and taller plants shade smaller ones; they also take up a greater proportion of the available water and nitrogen. The above-ground space in each plot is divided into 1 m deep layers for the purposes of calculating irradiance interception; horizontal variation in the plot environment is not treated. The soil is represented as a single layer, with a daily hydrological budget. Decomposition of soil organic matter is calculated using an empirical sub-model. The initial size of each tree seedling is stochastic. To predict the mean behaviour of the model for a particular boundary condition it is necessary to simulate a number of plots. Hybrid v3.0 has been written with three major requirements in mind: (i) the carbon, water, and nutrient cycles must be fully coupled in the soil-plant-atmosphere system; (ii) the internal constraints on the model's behaviour, and the driving forces for the model, must be the same as those which operate in nature (e.g., climate, nitrogen deposition, and the atmospheric concentrations of \{CO2\} and O2); and (iii) the model must be constructed so that it is capable of predicting transient as well as equilibrium responses to climate change. These conditions have largely been met by constructing the model around a set of fundamental hypotheses regarding the general constraints under which plants and soils behave, independently of any particular location or time. The model is thus potentially capable of making reliable predictions of ecosystem behaviour and structure under future, new, atmospheric conditions. The model is tested for a site in eastern North America. A quasi-equilibrium is reached after approximately 250 years with 10 plots. It is found that more plots are not necessary in order to obtain a reliable estimate of mean behaviour. Predictions of productivity, leaf area index, foliage nitrogen, soil carbon, and biomass carbon are all within the range expected for this location. Mortality is shown to be a necessary model component; without it large trees reach a maximum size, and then remain in dynamic equilibrium with the climate, without dying. The model runs at a rate of 0.176 s plot-1 year-1 on a workstation (a 500 year simulation, with 10 plots, thus takes approximately 15 min). A sensitivity analysis demonstrates the importance of the parameterisation of phenology, photosynthesis, and foliage/fine root carbon and nitrogen partitioning for the overall carbon balance of the modelled ecosystem. Hybrid v3.0 has been written with the intention of using it to represent the terrestrial biosphere in a total earth system model. This would be achieved by linking it to models of other components of the earth system, such as the climate and the oceans, in a fully coupled manner. This total earth system model could then be used to answer a large range of questions concerning global environmental change.},

The density of honeybees in the field was significantly related to distance from an apiary. Other gradients in the field were investigated with cages that excluded honeybees, the cages being used to calculate correlation factors to compensate for variations in yield due to parameters other than insect density. The results showed that the design was practicable, and indicated that higher densities increased both seed yield and oil content of seed. The method needs to be tested where a more pronounced density gradient can be obtained.},

  abstract  = {There is mounting evidence of pollinator decline all over the world and consequences in many agricultural areas could be significant. We assessed these consequences by measuring 1) the contribution of insect pollination to the world agricultural output economic value, and 2) the vulnerability of world agriculture in the face of pollinator decline. We used a bioeconomic approach, which integrated the production dependence ratio on pollinators, for the 100 crops used directly for human food worldwide as listed by FAO. The total economic value of pollination worldwide amounted to €153 billion, which represented 9.5% of the value of the world agricultural production used for human food in 2005. In terms of welfare, the consumer surplus loss was estimated between €190 and €310 billion based upon average price elasticities of -1.5 to -0.8, respectively. Vegetables and fruits were the leading crop categories in value of insect pollination with about €50 billion each, followed by edible oil crops, stimulants, nuts and spices. The production value of a ton of the crop categories that do not depend on insect pollination averaged €151 while that of those that are pollinator-dependent averaged €761. The vulnerability ratio was calculated for each crop category at the regional and world scales as the ratio between the economic value of pollination and the current total crop value. This ratio varied considerably among crop categories and there was a positive correlation between the rate of vulnerability to pollinators decline of a crop category and its value per production unit. Looking at the capacity to nourish the world population after pollinator loss, the production of 3 crop categories - namely fruits, vegetables, and stimulants - will clearly be below the current consumption level at the world scale and even more so for certain regions like Europe. Yet, although our valuation clearly demonstrates the economic importance of insect pollinators, it cannot be considered as a scenario since it does not take into account the strategic responses of the markets.},

A growth chamber study was conducted to determine the effect of short periods of high temperature and water stress at different developmental stages on seed yield and yield components of Brassica crops. Two canola-quality Brassica juncea ‘PC98-44’ and ‘PC98-45’, a Brassica napus canola ‘Quantum’, and a B. juncea oriental mustard ‘Cutlass’ were grown under 20/18°C day/night temperatures with photoperiod of 16/8 h light/dark. High (35/18°C) and moderate (28/18°C) temperature stress was imposed for 10 d during bud formation, flowering, and pod development. Low (90% available water) and high (50% available water) water stress was imposed in combination with the temperature treatments. 

On average, the 35/18°C stress reduced main stem pods by 75%, seeds/pod 25%, and seed weight 22% from the control. Seed yield per plant was reduced by 15% when plants were severely (35/18°C) stressed during bud formation, 58% when stressed during flowering, and 77% when stressed during pod development. Plants stressed at earlier growth stages exhibited recovery, whereas stress during pod development severely reduced most of the yield components. Effect of water stress on seed yield was minimal regardless of crop developmental stage. The four Brassica cultivars responded similarly to water stress. In response to temperature stress, B. juncea produced greater number of pods per plant but had a great rate of pod infertility than B. napus. Seed yield of B. juncea in semiarid environments can be increased by improving pod fertility, whereas the seed yield of B. napus can be increased by improving pod pro duction and retention.

  abstract  = {Neonicotinoid insecticides used to treat the seeds of bee-attractive crops occur in trace amounts in nectar and pollen. Possible harm to bees has resulted in the European Commission imposing a precautionary two-year moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids on bee-attractive crops from 2013. Recent laboratory and semi-field studies on colony-level effects of neonicotinoids assumed exclusive or near-exclusive levels of colony foraging on a treated crop. But is this a realistic assumption? Six honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies were monitored over two springs (April-May 2011/12) in two neighbouring locations (urban and rural) in and near Brighton, UK, to quantify foraging on oilseed rape, the most widespread bee-attractive crop in the UK, by decoding waggle dances and trapping pollen. The study area was representative of the \{UK\} agricultural landscape in that the percentage area cover of the blooming oilseed rape fields around the rural location was similar to the national average (3.3-3.9% vs 3.1%). The amount of foraging on oilseed rape fields, as indicated by dance decoding, was variable, but low, 0-0.02% for the urban and 2-26% for the rural location. Almost all foraging, 91-99%, was within 2km, even though honey bees can forage at distances of over 10km. Pollen trapping in 2012 supported the dance decoding results, with oilseed rape pollen comprising 14% of pollen pellets collected by foragers from rural and 4% from urban hives. The results of this study have implications for policy as they cast doubt on the generality of some previous studies on colony-level effects on social bees conducted in laboratory and semi-field settings.},

Yet, deliberate physical importation of single species (eg European honey bees) into crop fields for pollination remains the mainstream management approach, and implementation of practices to enhance crop yield (production per area) through wild insects is only just beginning. With few exceptions, studies measuring the impacts of pollinator-supporting practices on wild-insect richness and pollination service success - particularly in relation to long-term crop yield and economic profit - are rare. Here, we provide a general framework and examples of approaches for enhancing pollinator richness and abundance, quantity and quality of pollen on stigmas, crop yield, and farmers’ profit, including some benefits detected only through long-term monitoring. We argue for integrating the promotion of wild-insect species richness with single-species management to benefit farmers and society.},

  abstract  = {Sustainable agricultural landscapes by definition provide high magnitude and stability of ecosystem services, biodiversity and crop productivity. However, few studies have considered landscape effects on the stability of ecosystem services. We tested whether isolation from florally diverse natural and semi-natural areas reduces the spatial and temporal stability of flower-visitor richness and pollination services in crop fields. We synthesised data from 29 studies with contrasting biomes, crop species and pollinator communities. Stability of flowervisitor richness, visitation rate (all insects except honey bees) and fruit set all decreased with distance from natural areas. At 1 km from adjacent natural areas, spatial stability decreased by 25, 16 and 9% for richness, visitation and fruit set, respectively, while temporal stability decreased by 39% for richness and 13% for visitation. Mean richness, visitation and fruit set also decreased with isolation, by 34, 27 and 16% at 1 km respectively. In contrast, honey bee visitation did not change with isolation and represented > 25% of crop visits in 21 studies. Therefore, wild pollinators are relevant for crop productivity and stability even when honey bees are abundant. Policies to preserve and restore natural areas in agricultural landscapes should enhance levels and reliability of pollination services.},

Whether such declines reduce crop yields, or are mitigated by managed pollinators such as honey
bees, is unclear. We found universally positive associations of fruit set with flower visitation by wild
insects in 41 crop systems worldwide. In contrast, fruit set increased significantly with flower visitation
by honey bees in only 14% of the systems surveyed. Overall, wild insects pollinated crops more
effectively; an increase in wild insect visitation enhanced fruit set by twice as much as an equivalent
increase in honey bee visitation. Visitation by wild insects and honey bees promoted fruit set
independently, so pollination by managed honey bees supplemented, rather than substituted for,
pollination by wild insects. Our results suggest that new practices for integrated management of
both honey bees and diverse wild insect assemblages will enhance global crop yields.},

Spring temperatures also modified the effects of ice conditions on timing of breeding. * 3At Coats Island, northern Hudson Bay, in low Arctic waters, the date of egg-laying has advanced since 1981, simultaneous with a decrease in summer ice cover in surrounding waters. Lower ice cover in this region is correlated with lower chick growth rates and lower adult body mass, suggesting that reduction in summer ice extent is having a negative effect on reproduction. * 4Conversely, at Prince Leopold Island, in the High Arctic, there has been no trend in summer ice cover and no detectable change in timing of breeding. Reproduction there is less successful in years of late ice than in years of early ice break-up. * 5Current trends suggest that continued warming should benefit birds breeding on the northern limit of the species range, while adversely affecting reproduction for those on the southern margin. The probable result will be an eventual northward displacement of the population. Although this type of effect has been widely predicted, this study is among the first to demonstrate a potential causal mechanism.},

seabird colonies. Philip Ashmole developed the hypothesis during studies of tropical terns. However, the idea has been widely applied
outside the tropics, and most evidence for the hypothesis has been based on studies of high-latitude seabirds. We modelled some expectations
for measurable variables, including foraging range, food availability and offspring development in relation to colony size for four seabird
types (based on characteristics of the genera Uria, Fratercula, Puffinus and Pterodroma) and tested the model predictions against currently
available data. We conclude that, although there is evidence for the existence of a zone of food depletion around seabird colonies, our model
suggests that this zone is unlikely to be detectable for small colonies and especially for colonies of far-ranging species such as petrels and
shearwaters. The hypothesis can be tested more effectively by measuring how food, feeding rates and feeding behaviour vary with distance
from a colony than by comparing foraging at colonies of various sizes.},

  abstract  = {Trap-nesting bees and wasps (Hymenoptera Aculeata) colonizing crop and fallow fields in an agricultural landscape were studied using 20 sown fields (pea, barley, rye, clover-grass mixtures, Phacelia tanacetifolia) and 20 fields with naturally developed vegetation (land 2-year old fields, both mown and unmown, and old meadows). Fourteen species of Apoidea, 4 of Sphecidae, 1 of Eumenidae and 4 of parasitoids were reared from reed nests exposed in these 40 fields of 10 field-types. Fields with naturally developed vegetation had twice as many species as sown fields, due to the distribution pattern of the 14 bee species, whereas the 9 predatory species (wasps and parasitoids) showed a rather uniform distribution. None of the trap-nesting bees were found in Phacelia fields, despite contrasting expectations of beekeepers. Old meadows showed a particularly high abundance and species richness, since only 10% of all traps were exposed, but 32% of all bee nests were sampled in old meadows, including 4 bee species that were not found elsewhere. Accordingly, species richness of fields with naturally developed vegetation showed a significant increase with age. Variability in Hymenoptera species numbers could be explained by corresponding differences in plant species numbers. The alternative hypothesis that field size or field connectivity influenced species richness was not supported. Habitats with great floral diversity appeared to offer better and richer food resources for the flower-visiting bees, whereas food availability apparently did not influence predatory wasps. The bees Osmia caerulescens and Megachile versicolor that had colonized early-successional fields took twice as long to provision cells as those that colonized late-successional meadows characterized by a greater plant species richness. In contrast, the eumenid wasp Ancistrocerus gazella took a similar period of time to provision cells in both field types. In addition, bee and wasp species of plant species-poor fields were on average significantly larger than those of plant-species-rich fields. Thus, body size appeared to be a good predictor of colonization ability. Management by cutting greatly increased plant species richness in early-successional set-aside fields and thus doubled species richness of bees. Cutting of early-successional habitats can be expected to benefit insects and plants in general, whereas older grassland should show the greatest insect diversity when both mown and unmown parts are present.},

  abstract  = {* 1Habitat requirements of solitary bees include nesting sites, food resources and nesting material. We used translocation experiments to establish foraging distances and measured foraging trip duration to analyse how solitary bees cope with the distance between nesting sites and suitable food plants in different habitat types.
* 2Maximum foraging distance between nesting site and food patch was 150-600 m for the 16 bee species examined. Foraging distance was correlated positively with body length. Mean foraging trip duration, measured for seven bee species, ranged from 6 to 28 min and was also correlated with body length. In a study of the polylectic species Osmia rufa
 , we found a significant decrease in foraging trip duration with increasing number of plant species. Logistic regressions showed that the oligolectic 
 Megachile lapponica
 nested in trap nests with a probability of 50% if the distance between trap nest and food patch was less than 250 m. The oligolectic 
 Chelostoma rapunculi utilized trap nests when the distance to the nearest food patch was less than 300 m.
* 3These experiments showed that solitary bees have a rather small foraging range so local habitat structure appears to be of more importance than large-scale landscape structure. All requirements for sustaining viable populations must be within this range. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain and restore a dense network of habitat patches in landscapes to ensure long-term sustainability of wild bee diversity and their ecological function as pollinators.},

  abstract  = {Recent reports of global declines in pollinator species imply an urgent need to assess the abundance of native pollinators and density-dependent benefits for linked plants. In this study, we investigated (1) pollinator nest distributions and estimated colony abundances, (2) the relationship between abundances of foraging workers and the number of nests they represent, (3) pollinator foraging ranges, and (4) the relationship between pollinator abundance and plant reproduction. We examined these questions in an alpine ecosystem in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, focusing on four alpine bumble bee species (Bombus balteatus, B. flavifrons, B. bifarius, and B. sylvicola), and two host plants that differ in their degrees of pollinator specialization (Trifolium dasyphyllum and T. parryi).Using microsatellites, we found that estimated colony abundances among Bombus species ranged from ~18 to 78 colonies/0.01 km2. The long-tongued species B. balteatus was most common, especially high above treeline, but the subalpine species B. bifarius was unexpectedly abundant for this elevation range. Nests detected among sampled foragers of each species were correlated with the number of foragers caught. Foraging ranges were smaller than expected for all Bombus species, ranging from 25 to 110 m. Fruit set for the specialized plant, Trifolium parryi, was positively related to the abundance of its Bombus pollinator. In contrast, fruit set for the generalized plant, T. dasyphyllum, was related to abundance of all Bombus species. Because forager abundance was related to nest abundance of each Bombus species and was an equally effective predictor of plant fecundity, forager inventories are probably suitable for assessing the health of outcrossing plant populations. However, nest abundance, rather than forager abundance, better reflects demographic and genetic health in populations of eusocial pollinators such as bumble bees. Development of models incorporating the parameters we have measured here (nest abundance, forager abundance, and foraging distance) could increase the usefulness of foraging worker inventories in monitoring, managing, and conserving pollinator populations.},

  abstract  = {Bee species diversity and the effectiveness of four sampling methods were investigated in a west-central Illinois restored tallgrass prairie. Bees were sampled using malaise traps, ground-level pan traps, elevated pan traps, and vane traps. A total of 4,622 bees representing 31 genera and 111 species were collected. Malaise traps collected the greatest number of bees and species, and ground-level pan traps the least. Among the pan traps and vane traps, blue-colored traps collected the greatest abundance and species richness, and yellow traps the least. Chao1 estimator and rarefaction analyses showed that substantial increases in sample sizes would be necessary to achieve asymptotic species richness levels, particularly if ground-level pan traps alone were used. Elevated pan traps and vane traps collected relatively similar species composition. Different colored pan traps at the same height collected more similar species composition than did those at different heights, but species composition of blue ground-level pan traps was relatively similar to elevated pan traps, regardless of color. Indicator species analysis revealed 22 species that were significantly associated with a specific trap type, and 11 species that were associated with a particular pan trap color/elevation. Results of this study show that elevated traps can increase the effectiveness of bee surveys in tallgrass prairie, and that a combination of trap types gives a more complete picture of the bee fauna than does a single survey method. These results should be considered along with cost, ease of use, and goals when planning and designing bee inventories.},

We illustrate their utility with an analysis of data taken from an experimental study of Echinacea angustifolia sampled from remnant prairie populations in western Minnesota. These models generalize both generalized linear models and survival analysis. The joint distribution is factorized as a product of conditional distributions, each an exponential family with the conditioning variable being the sample size of the conditional distribution. The model may be heterogeneous, each conditional distribution being from a different exponential family. We show that the joint distribution is from a flat exponential family and derive its canonical parameters, Fisher information and other properties. These models are implemented in an R package ‘aster’ available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network, CRAN.},

  abstract  = {Concerns have been raised that invertebrate pollinators of crops and wild plants are in decline as a result of modern agricultural practices, habitat degradation, and introduced pests and diseases. This has led to demands for a response by land managers, conservationists and political decision makers to the impending ‘global pollinator crisis’. In questioning this crisis, it becomes apparent that perceptions of a pollinator crisis are driven mainly by reported declines of crop-pollinating honeybees in North America, and bumblebees and butterflies in Europe, whereas native pollinator communities elsewhere show mixed responses to environmental change. Additionally, few staple food crops depend on pollinator services, and most crops that do are grown at small scales in diversified agro-ecosystems that are likely to support healthy pollinator communities, or in highly managed systems that are largely independent of wild pollinators. Consequently, justifying conservation action on the basis of deteriorating pollinator services might be misplaced. Nevertheless, existing initiatives to monitor pollinators are well founded, given the uncertainty about the dynamics of pollinator populations.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT The ecological significance of spacing among plants in contributing to the maintenance of species richness, particularly in tropical forests, has received considerable attention that has largely focussed on distance- and density-dependent seed and seedling mortality. More recently it has become apparent that plant spacing is also relevant to pollination, which often constrains seed production. While seed and seedling survival is reduced at high conspecific densities, pollination success, by contrast, is positively correlated to local conspecific density. Distance-dependent mechanisms acting on pollination and seed production have now been described for a variety of plants, with relatively isolated plants or fragmented populations generally suffering reduced fecundity due to pollen limitation. Yet there is considerable variability in the vulnerability of plant species to pollination failure, which may be a function of breeding system, life history, the pollination vector, the degree of specialisation among plants and their pollinators, and other indirect effects of habitat change acting on plants or pollinators. As reduced tree densities and population fragmentation are common outcomes of anthropogenically altered landscapes, understanding how pollination processes are affected in such degraded landscapes can inform effective conservation and management of remaining natural areas.},

Global changes such as habitat losses, invasions of exotic species and climate change have been suggested as the main causes of the decline of pollinators. In this study, the influence of climate change on the distribution of 10 species of Brazilian bees was estimated with species distribution modelling. We used Maxent algorithm (maximum entropy) and two different scenarios, an optimistic and a pessimistic, to the years 2050 and 2080. We also evaluated the percentage reduction of species habitat based on the future scenarios of climate change through Geographic Information System (GIS). Results showed that the total area of suitable habitats decreased for all species but one under the different future scenarios. The greatest reductions in habitat area were found for Melipona bicolor bicolor and Melipona scutellaris, which occur predominantly in areas related originally to Atlantic Moist Forest. The species analysed have been reported to be pollinators of some regional crops and the consequence of their decrease for these crops needs further clarification.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, there have been several studies using open top chambers (OTCs) or cloches to examine the response of Arctic plant communities to artificially elevated temperatures. Few, however, have investigated multitrophic systems, or the effects of both temperature and vertebrate grazing treatments on invertebrates. This study investigated trophic interactions between an herbivorous insect (Sitobion calvulum, Aphididae), a woody perennial host plant (Salix polaris) and a selective vertebrate grazer (barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis). In a factorial experiment, the responses of the insect and its host to elevated temperatures using open top chambers (OTCs) and to three levels of goose grazing pressure were assessed over two summer growing seasons (2004 and 2005). OTCs significantly enhanced the leaf phenology of Salix in both years and there was a significant OTC by goose presence interaction in 2004. Salix leaf number was unaffected by treatments in both years, but OTCs increased leaf size and mass in 2005. Salix reproduction and the phenology of flowers were unaffected by both treatments. Aphid densities were increased by OTCs but unaffected by goose presence in both years. While goose presence had little effect on aphid density or host plant phenology in this system, the OTC effects provide interesting insights into the possibility of phenological synchrony disruption. The advanced phenology of Salix effectively lengthens the growing season for the plant, but despite a close association with leaf maturity, the population dynamics of the aphid appeared to lack a similar phenological response, except for the increased population observed.},

  abstract  = {Climate change has the potential to desynchronize the phenologies of interdependent species, with potentially catastrophic effects on mutualist populations. Phenologies can evolve, but the role of evolution in the response of mutualisms to climate change is poorly understood. We developed a model that explicitly considers both the evolution and the population dynamics of a plant-pollinator mutualism under climate change. How the populations evolve, and thus whether the populations and the mutualism persist, depends not only on the rate of climate change but also on the densities and phenologies of other species in the community. Abundant alternative mutualist partners with broad temporal distributions can make a mutualism more robust to climate change, while abundant alternative partners with narrow temporal distributions can make a mutualism less robust. How community composition and the rate of climate change affect the persistence of mutualisms is mediated by two-species Allee thresholds. Understanding these thresholds will help researchers to identify those mutualisms at highest risk owing to climate change.},
  comment   = {Interesting model. Used inheritance principles coupled with simple population models to show ESS for pollinator/plant populations

However:
- Assumes that phenological emergence is inherently genetic, but there is also a plastic element which responds to things like temperature
- Assumes all selection on pollinator community is driven by change in flowering day, rather than conditions which are tied to flowering day
- Assumes the focal plant will be the only one to shift, causing this weird drag towards both the alternate forage source as well as the focal source (theta_a and theta_f). In reality, most of the flowering community will probably shift, not just a single species.},

  abstract  = {We use Hamilton's Rule to investigate effects of genetic relatedness on the predicted size of social groups. We assume an aggregation economy; individual fitness initially increases with group size, but in sufficiently large groups each member's individual fitness declines with further increments in the size of the group. We model two processes of group formation, designated free entry and group-controlled entry. The first model assumes that solitary individuals decide to join groups or remain alone; group size equilibrates when solitaries no longer choose to join. The second model allows group members to regulate the size of the group, so that the predicted group size results from members' decisions to repel or accept intruding solitaries. Both the Nash equilibrium group size and any change in the equilibrium caused by varying the level of relatedness depend on the particular entry rule assumed. The largest equilibrium group size occurs when solitaries choose between joining or not joining and individuals are unrelated. Increasing genetic relatedness may reduce and can never increase, equilibrium group size when this entry rule applies. The smallest equilibrium group size occurs when group members choose between repelling or accepting intruders and individuals are unrelated. Under this entry rule, increasing genetic relatedness can increase and can never decrease, equilibrium group size. We extend the models' predictions to suggest when individuals should prefer kin vs non-kin as members of the same group.},

Labelled glucose was incorporated into trehalose within 2 min of feeding. Flight speed was positively correlated with food concentration (1-4 molar glucose) for workers and drones, and the speed attained by queens was similar to that of workers. Only the speed of drones was temperature dependent and was significantly higher than that of workers and queens. Independent of glucose concentration, workers require more sugar per metre flown and gram body weight, and per gram thorax weight, than the much heavier drones and queens.

The model calculates not just the conversion efficiency of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) but also the component carbon fluxes that ultimately determine net and gross primary production. This approach, driven with remotely sensed observations, moves beyond simple correlative or associative models to a more mechanistic basis and avoids the need for a full suite of ecophysiological process algorithms that require explicit (e.g. species-specific) parameterization. We show that surface variables recovered from the satellite observations, including net primary production, are in good agreement with field measurements and independent model simulations in a number of ecosystems. These results illustrate the utility of \{PEMs\} for terrestrial primary production modeling over large areas and suggest that some complex ecophysiological models may be functionally simpler than their structure suggests.},

This article reviews different forms of pollen tube transmitting tracts within the style as well as possibilities for bridging the gap from the transmitting tissue to the ovule. The pollen tube transmitting tissue is the place of possible pollen tube competition. Often the number of pollen grains deposited onto the stigma or stigmata of a flower exceeds the number of ovules in the ovary of the pollinated flower. In the styles of most taxa investigated, a reduction in number of the pollen tubes occurs from the stigma to the ovary (pollen tube attrition): the pollen tubes compete for entry into the embryo sac of the ovules within the ovary. A prediction of the extent of pollen tube competition can be partially equated to the P-S/O ratio. This ratio relates the total number of pollen grains (P) deposited onto the stigmata (S) at the end of the female phase of anthesis (stigma receptivity) to the number of ovules (O) present in the ovary. Some quantitative data on pollen load on the stigma or stigmata and resulting pollen tube competition will be demonstrated especially in the choricarpous gynoecium of Geum rivale (Rosaceae) and in the coenocarpous gynoecium of Cichorium intybus (Asteraceae). Data from this study are compared with data of other taxa obtained from the literature.},

Animal pollinators decline as a consequence of five major global change pressures: climate change, landscape alteration, agricultural intensification, non-native species, and spread of pathogens. These pressures, which differ in their biotic or abiotic nature and their spatiotemporal scales, can interact in nonadditive ways (synergistically or antagonistically), but are rarely considered together in studies of pollinator and/or pollination decline. Management actions aimed at buffering the impacts of a particular pressure could thereby prove ineffective if another pressure is present. Here, we focus on empirical evidence of the combined effects of global change pressures on pollination, highlighting gaps in current knowledge and future research needs.},

  Abstract                 = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an organism into unitary ``traits'' and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with Bauplane so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain why they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support Darwin's own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

  abstract  = {* Neonicotinoids are now the most widely used insecticides in the world. They act systemically, travelling through plant tissues and protecting all parts of the crop, and are widely applied as seed dressings. As neurotoxins with high toxicity to most arthropods, they provide effective pest control and have numerous uses in arable farming and horticulture.

* However, the prophylactic use of broad-spectrum pesticides goes against the long-established principles of integrated pest management (IPM), leading to environmental concerns.

* It has recently emerged that neonicotinoids can persist and accumulate in soils. They are water soluble and prone to leaching into waterways. Being systemic, they are found in nectar and pollen of treated crops. Reported levels in soils, waterways, field margin plants and floral resources overlap substantially with concentrations that are sufficient to control pests in crops, and commonly exceed the LC50 (the concentration which kills 50% of individuals) for beneficial organisms. Concentrations in nectar and pollen in crops are sufficient to impact substantially on colony reproduction in bumblebees.

* Although vertebrates are less susceptible than arthropods, consumption of small numbers of dressed seeds offers a route to direct mortality in birds and mammals.

* Synthesis and applications. Major knowledge gaps remain, but current use of neonicotinoids is likely to be impacting on a broad range of non-target taxa including pollinators and soil and aquatic invertebrates and hence threatens a range of ecosystem services.},

  abstract  = {The majority of species of flowering plants rely on pollination by insects, so that their reproductive success and in part their population structure are determined by insect behaviour. The foraging behaviour of insect pollinators is flexible and complex, because efficient collection of nectar or pollen is no simple matter. Each flower provides a variable but generally small reward that is often hidden, flowers are patchily distributed in time and space, and are erratically depleted of rewards by other foragers. Insects that specialise in visiting flowers have evolved an array of foraging strategies that act to improve their efficiency, which in turn determine the reproductive success of the plants that they visit. This review attempts a synthesis of the recent literature on selectivity in pollinator foraging behaviour, in terms of the species, patch and individual flowers that they choose to visit. The variable nature of floral resources necessitate foraging behaviour based upon flexible learning, so that foragers can respond to the pattern of rewards that they encounter. Fidelity to particular species allows foragers to learn appropriate handling skills and so reduce handling times, but may also be favoured by use of a search image to detect flowers. The rewards received are also used to determine the spatial patterns of searches; distance and direction of flights are adjusted so that foragers tend to remain within rewarding patches and depart swiftly from unrewarding ones. The distribution of foragers among patchy resources generally conforms to the expectations of two simple optimal foraging models, the ideal free distribution and the marginal value theorem. Insects are able to learn to discriminate among flowers of their preferred species on the basis of subtle differences in floral morphology. They may discriminate upon the basis of flower size, age, sex or symmetry and so choose the more rewarding flowers. Some insects are also able to distinguish and reject depleted flowers on the basis of ephemeral odours left by previous visitors. These odours have recently been implicated as a mechanism involved in interspecific interactions between foragers. From the point of view of a plant reliant upon insect pollination, the behaviour of its pollinators (and hence its reproductive success) is likely to vary according to the rewards offered, the size and complexity of floral displays used to advertise their location, the distribution of conspecific and of rewards offered by other plant species, and the abundance and behaviour of other flower visitors.},

  abstract  = {Many bumblebee (Bombus) species are thought to have declined in abundance in the last 50 years, while a small number of species remain abundant. Here we examine which factors render some British bumblebee species more susceptible to environmental change than others. We present forage data on workers of 15 bumblebee species gathered from 172 one hour searches conducted at sites in southern UK, the Hebrides (western Scotland) and in New Zealand (to which \{UK\} bumblebees were introduced). We also review data on distribution, phenology and tongue length of these species. Overall, Fabaceae appear to be the major pollen source for most bumblebee species. In particular, long-tongued, late emerging species such as Bombus ruderatus, Bombus humilis and Bombus subterraneus specialize heavily in gathering pollen from Fabaceae, and this group of bumblebee species have all declined. Some of them are also at the edge of their geographic range in the UK, which may have rendered them more sensitive to environmental change. The decline of many bumblebee species is probably attributable largely to the loss of unimproved flower-rich grasslands, a habitat rich in Fabaceae. The bumblebee species that remain abundant are mostly short-tongued species that emerge early in the season and have less specialized diets; these species are very common in suburban gardens where they are able to exploit the broad range of floral resources. A third group of bumblebees are strongly associated with Ericaceae in moorland and heathland habitats, and have probably always had restricted distributions. A small number of species are not so easily categorised. Bombus soroeensis and B. ruderarius are not dietary specialists, nor are they close to the limit of their geographic range, but nevertheless they have declined. Much of the ecology of rare bumblebee species remains poorly understood and in need of further study.},

  abstract  = {Bees are subject to numerous pressures in the modern world. The abundance and diversity of flowers has declined; bees are chronically exposed to cocktails of agrochemicals, and they are simultaneously exposed to novel parasites accidentally spread by humans. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these problems in the future. Stressors do not act in isolation; for example, pesticide exposure can impair both detoxification mechanisms and immune responses, rendering bees more susceptible to parasites. It seems certain that chronic exposure to multiple interacting stressors is driving honey bee colony losses and declines of wild pollinators, but such interactions are not addressed by current regulatory procedures, and studying these interactions experimentally poses a major challenge. In the meantime, taking steps to reduce stress on bees would seem prudent; incorporating flower-rich habitat into farmland, reducing pesticide use through adopting more sustainable farming methods, and enforcing effective quarantine measures on bee movements are all practical measures that should be adopted. Effective monitoring of wild pollinator populations is urgently needed to inform management strategies into the future.},

  abstract  = {Many insects foraging for nectar or pollen exhibit flower constancy, a learned fidelity to a particular species of plant that previously provided a reward. Constancy may persist even when alternative flowers are available that provide a greater or less variable reward. This strategy entails more travelling time than one of generalization (visiting all suitable flowers as they are encountered). The consensus at present is that this increase in travelling time is offset by decreases in handling time; switching between flower species incurs a cost in time spent learning to ‘handle’ the new flower species that is avoided by remaining constant. If this is so, then the optimal strategy should depend upon the density of flower species (and thus the travelling time), with switching occurring below a threshold density of the target flower species. This prediction is tested using the butterfly,Thymelicus flavus, by analysing foraging patterns under natural conditions. This species exhibited constancy: of 465 visits to flowers 85% were to the same species as last visited. As predicted switches between flower species occurred in response to low encounter rates of the flower species on which the individual had previously fed. However, butterflies ignored the vast majority of suitable flowers that they encountered, even when they were of the species to which they were constant. This casts doubt on explanations for flower constancy as an adaptive strategy that minimizes handling time and maximizes resource acquisition per unit time within learning constraints.},

Here we consider why foragers follow dances and discuss the function of the dance as a multicomponent signal. We argue that the ‘dance language’ is just one information component of the waggle dance and that the two terms should not be used synonymously. We propose that location information is often backup information to be used in case information acquired directly from the environment about food sources is not available, is of poor quality or is associated with unprofitable food sources.},

  abstract  = {This paper evaluates both the ideas and empirical evidence pertaining to the control of species density in herbaceous plant communities. While most theoretical discussions of species density have emphasized the importance of habitat productivity and disturbance regimes, many other factors (e.g. species pools, plant litter accumulation, plant morphology) have been proposed to be important. A review of literature presenting observations on the density of species in small plots (in the vicinity of a few square meters or less), as well as experimental studies, suggests several generalizations: (1) Available data are consistent with an underlying unimodal relationship between species density and total community biomass. While variance in species density is often poorly explained by predictor variables, there is strong evidence that high levels of community biomass are antagonistic to high species density. (2) Community biomass is just one of several factors affecting variations in species density. Multivariate analyses typically explain more than twice as much variance in species density as can be explained by community biomass alone. (3) Disturbance has important and sometimes complex effects on species density. In general, the evidence is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis but exceptions exist and effects can be complex. (4) Gradients in the species pool can have important influences on patterns of species density. Evidence is mounting that a considerable amount of the observed variability in species density within a landscape or region may result from environmental effects on the species pool. (5) Several additional factors deserve greater consideration, including time lags, species composition, plant morphology, plant density and soil microbial effects. Based on the available evidence, a conceptual model of the primary factors controlling species density is presented here. This model suggests that species density is controlled by the effects of disturbance, total community biomass, colonization, the species pool and spatial heterogeneity. The structure of the model leads to two main expectations: (1) while community biomass is important, multivariate approaches will be required to understand patterns of variation in species density, and (2) species density will be more highly correlated with light penetration to the soil surface, than with above-ground biomass, and even less well correlated with plant growth rates (productivity) or habitat fertility. At present, data are insufficient to evaluate the relative importance of the processes controlling species density. Much more work is needed if we are to adequately predict the effects of environmental changes on plant communities and species diversity.},

  abstract  = {* Perhaps no other pair of variables in ecology has generated as much discussion as species richness and ecosystem productivity, as illustrated by the reactions by Pierce () and others to Adler et al.'s () report that empirical patterns are weak and inconsistent. Adler et al. () argued we need to move beyond a focus on simplistic bivariate relationships and test mechanistic, multivariate causal hypotheses. We feel the continuing debate over productivity-richness relationships (PRRs) provides a focused context for illustrating the fundamental difficulties of using bivariate relationships to gain scientific understanding.


* Pierce () disputes Adler et al.'s () conclusion that bivariate productivity-richness relationships (PRRs) are ‘weak and variable’. He argues, instead, that relationships in the Adler et al. data are actually strong and, further, that failure to adhere to the humped-back model (HBM; sensu Grime ) threatens scientists' ability to advise conservationists. Here, we show that Pierce's reanalyses are invalid, that statistically significant boundary relations in the Adler et al. data are difficult to detect when proper methods are used and that his advice neither advances scientific understanding nor provides the quantitative forecasts actually needed by decision makers.


* We begin by examining Grimes' HBM through the lens of causal networks. We first translate the ideas contained in the HBM into a causal diagram, which shows explicitly how multiple processes are hypothesized to control biomass production and richness and their interrelationship. We then evaluate the causal diagram using structural equation modelling and example data from a published study of meadows in Finland. Formal analysis rejects the literal translation of the HBM and reveals additional processes at work. This exercise shows how the practice of abstracting systems as causal networks (i) clarifies possible hypotheses, (ii) permits explicit testing and (iii) provides more powerful and useful predictions.


* Building on the Finnish meadow example, we contrast the utility of bivariate plots compared with structural equation models for investigating underlying processes. Simulations illustrate the fallibility of bivariate analysis as a means of supporting one theory over another, while models based on causal networks can quantify the sensitivity of diversity patterns to both management and natural constraints.


* A key piece of Pierce's critique of Adler et al.'s conclusions relies on upper boundary regression which he claims to reveal strong relationships between production and richness in Adler et al.'s original data. We demonstrate that this technique shows strong associations in purely random data and is invalid for Adler et al.'s data because it depends on a uniform data distribution. We instead perform quantile regression on both the site-level summaries of the data and the plot-level data (using mixed-model quantile regression). Using a variety of nonlinear curve-fitting approaches, we were unable to detect a significant humped-shape boundary in the Adler et al. data. We reiterate that the bivariate productivity-richness relationships in Adler et al.'s data are weak and variable.


* We urge ecologists to consider productivity-richness relationships through the lens of causal networks to advance our understanding beyond bivariate analysis. Further, we emphasize that models based on a causal network conceptualization can also provide more meaningful guidance for conservation management than can a bivariate perspective. Measuring only two variables does not permit the evaluation of complex ideas nor resolve debates about underlying mechanisms.},

  abstract  = {Ideal free distribution (IFD) theory has frequently been used to investigate habitat selection when fitness payoffs are frequency-dependent. To date, however, researchers have not considered the possibility that individuals may simultaneously differ in their ability to compete for resources and their susceptibility to predation. Such differences might be expected to occur as a consequence of differences in body size, morphology or behaviour. Here, we develop a model to investigate the effects of differences in competitive ability and mortality risk on the equilibrium distribution of competitors across habitats. For simplicity, we consider the case of two competitor types competing for resources in an environment containing two habitats: a productive, but risky habitat and a less productive, safer habitat. In general, the model predicts that when individual mortality risk is independent of the density of competitors within a habitat, competitor types will tend to be assorted by competitive ability, with the competitor type experiencing the higher ratio of mortality risk across the habitats occurring predominantly in the safer, but less productive habitat. In contrast, when individual mortality risk within a habitat is diluted by competitor number, the model predicts that both competitor types will tend to aggregate in the same habitat, with the chosen habitat depending on which competitor type experiences the higher ratio of mortality risk across the habitats. When good competitors experience a higher ratio of mortality risk than poor competitors, both competitor types will tend to aggregate in the risky, but productive habitat. However, when poor competitors experience the higher ratio of mortality risk, both competitor types will tend to aggregate in the safer, but less productive habitat. Because our model can be applied to both intra- and interspecific resource competition, its results suggest a new potential mechanism for the co-existence of competitor types within a habitat.},

Yet honey bees are not always the most efficient pollinators of all crops and are declining in various parts of the world. Crop pollination shortages are becoming increasingly common. We found that behavioral interactions between wild and honey bees increase the pollination efficiency of honey bees on hybrid sunflower up to 5-fold, effectively doubling honey bee pollination services on the average field. These indirect contributions caused by interspecific interactions between wild and honey bees were more than five times more important than the contributions wild bees make to sunflower pollination directly. Both proximity to natural habitat and crop planting practices were significantly correlated with pollination services provided directly and indirectly by wild bees. Our results suggest that conserving wild habitat at the landscape scale and altering selected farm management techniques could increase hybrid sunflower production. These findings also demonstrate the economic importance of interspecific interactions for ecosystem services and suggest that protecting wild bee populations can help buffer the human food supply from honey bee shortages.},

However, the contribution of wild bees remains unmeasured for many crops, and the effects of anthropogenic change on many bee species are unstudied. We experimentally investigated how pollination by wild bees affects tomato production in northern California. We found that wild bees substantially increase the production of field-grown tomato, a crop generally considered self-pollinating. Surveys of the bee community on 14 organic fields that varied in proximity to natural habitat showed that the primary bee visitors, Anthophora urbana Cresson and Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski, were affected differently by land management practices. B. vosnesenskii was found primarily on farms proximate to natural habitats, but neither proximity to natural habitat nor tomato floral abundance, temperature, or year explained variation in the visitation rates of A. urbana. Natural habitat appears to increase B. vosnesenskii populations and should be preserved near farms. Additional research is needed to determine how to maintain A. urbana. Species-specific differences in dependency on natural habitats underscore the importance of considering the natural histories of individual bee species when projecting population trends of pollinators and designing management plans for pollination services. Thus, to maintain an entire bee community, multiple approaches, including maintaining natural habitat, should be implemented.},

We used data from 96 records of 62 bee species to determine whether body size predicts foraging distance. We regressed maximum and typical foraging distances on body size and found highly significant and explanatory nonlinear relationships. We used a second data set to: (1) compare observed reports of foraging distance to the distances predicted by our regression equations and (2) assess the biases inherent to the different techniques that have been used to assess foraging distance. The equations we present can be used to predict foraging distances for many bee species, based on a simple measurement of body size.},

  abstract  = {It is suggested that evolution in plants may be associated with the emergence of three primary strategies, each of which may be identified by reference to a number of characteristics including morphological features, resource allocation, phenology, and response to stress. The competitive strategy prevails in productive, relatively undisturbed vegetation, the stress-tolerant strategy is associated with continuously unproductive conditions, and the ruderal strategy is characteristic of severely disturbed but potentially productive habitats. A triangular model based upon the three strategies may be reconciled with the theory of r- and K-selection, provides an insight into the processes of vegetation succession and dominance, and appears to be capable of extension to fungi and to animals.},

Bout lengths increased with display size in 1999, and bouts were longer in sparse patches. However, the actual rate of increase with display size was independent of plant density for both response measures.
* 3The proportion of flowers visited decreased with floral display size in both years, and in 1999 the decline was faster in high-density patches. As a result, the proportion visited was higher in dense patches for the smallest display sizes, and higher in sparse patches for larger display sizes.
* 4Flower visitation rate decreased with floral display size in both years. This is inconsistent with the idea that bees achieve an ideal free distribution across flowers. There was no significant effect of plant density.

  Abstract                 = {For plant populations, gene movement through pollen and seed dispersal governs the size of local genetic neighbourhoods and shapes the opportunities for natural selection and genetic drift. A critical question is how together these two processes influence the evolutionary dynamics of local populations. To assess the respective contributions of pollen and seed flow, we propose a novel indirect assessment of the separate male and female gametic contributions to total effective parental size (Ne), based on parental correlations estimated via kinship coefficients, that can be applied to data sets that include unambiguous genotypes for male and female gametic contributions. Using the endemic Californian valley oak (Quercus lobata) as our study species, we apply this method to a set of microsatellite genotypes for two distinct ecological sets of naturally recruiting seedlings with acorns attached. We found that the effective numbers of contributing male parents (Nep) exceed effective numbers of female parents (Nem) for seedlings established beneath adult trees (Nep = 8.1 and Nem = 1.1), as well as for seedlings established away from adult trees (Nep = 15.4 and Nem = 2.7), illustrating that seed dispersal enhances pollen dispersal and increases the effective number of seed sources in open seedling patches. The resulting effective parental size of seedling populations translates into smaller effective numbers of parents for undispersed vs. dispersed seedlings (Ne = 3.6 and Ne = 6.7, respectively). This study introduces a novel statistic method and provides important new evidence that, on a short-term temporal scale, seed dispersal shapes the local neighbourhood size of new recruits.},

  abstract  = {Declines in many bumble bee species have been documented in Europe raising several ecological and economic concerns. The nature and extent of bumble bee decline in North America is poorly understood due mainly to a lack of baseline and long-term data. Museum collections provide excellent sources of information on past and current species distributions, which can be used to infer changes in the composition of insect communities. Using the Illinois Natural History Survey’s electronic database of Hymenoptera and a recent biodiversity survey of historically sampled localities, we were able to examine changes in the richness and distribution of the bumble bee fauna of Illinois over the last century. We found that bumble bee species richness declined substantially during the middle of the century (1940–1960). Four species were locally extirpated: Bombus borealis, Bombus ternarius, Bombus terricola and Bombus variabilis. The ranges of Bombus affinis, Bombus fraternus, Bombus pensylvanicus and Bombus vagans have also decreased in Illinois. Our analyses also indicated that current bumble bee diversity is highest in northern Illinois, where conservation efforts would be most productive. Our study demonstrates that half of the bumble bee species found historically in Illinois have been locally extirpated or have suffered declines, supporting observations of broader declines in North America. Major declines in the bumble bee fauna coincided with large-scale agricultural intensification in Illinois between 1940 and 1960. Attempts to conserve bumble bees in Illinois should involve wildlife-friendly approaches to agriculture, such as increasing agricultural land set-asides and hedgerows, and employing integrated pest management.},

The transitions between the two generations in the female occur in the ovule, the site of meiosis, female gametogenesis and double fertilization. The intimate association of sporophytic and gametophytic tissues in the ovule allows an investigation of their cellular interactions during ovule and seed development. In Arabidopsis, several sporophytically acting loci which primarily affect the morphogenesis of the integuments have been identified. Early acting genes may respond to positional information leading to a region-specific initiation of morphogenesis, whereas later acting genes affect cellular aspects of integument growth. Much less is known about the mechanisms controlling the development of the megagametophyte. Comparative morphology and genetic analyses suggests that regulatory mechanisms ensure a tight coordination of independently controlled cellular processes with cell specification and differentiation.},

  Abstract                 = {The extreme seasonality of the High Arctic creates very different flowering conditions for plants in areas of early and late snowmelt. Therefore, future reproductive responses to climate change may be dependent on the timing of snowmelt. We combined genetic, morphological, and long-term monitoring data on Dryas from a High Arctic hybrid zone of D. integrifolia and D. octopetala to assess whether climate variation influenced flowering differently in areas of early and late snowmelt, and whether this could have a genetic origin. We found a non-linear relationship between timing of snowmelt and flowering. The duration of the period between snowmelt and the onset of flowering (pre-floration interval) varied with the date of snowmelt. Shorter pre-floration intervals were associated with warmer average temperature during the pre-floration intervals in both early and late melting plots. However, the pre-floration interval was much shorter in early than in late plots at the same average temperature. Likewise, the interannual variation in flower abundance differed between early and late melting plots. Flower abundance was negatively influenced by frost after snowmelt in the year of flowering in early plots. In late plots, flower abundance was positively influenced by the length of the previous growing season. We identified two morpho-types in the study area, but their distribution and genetic differentiation was not related to the snowmelt gradient. We conclude that the different flowering responses found along the snowmelt gradient are a result of environmental variation. Based on our results and projected climatic change for the study area, we predict that the onset of flowering will advance and flower abundance will increase in areas of early snowmelt. In areas of late snowmelt, the onset of flowering will remain unchanged or be delayed and flower abundance will decrease.},

these changes. Long-term studies of individual arthropod species from the Arctic are, however, virtually absent. We examined
butterfly specimens collected from yellow pitfall traps over 14 years (1996-2009) at Zackenberg in high-{Arctic}, north-east
Greenland. Specimens were previously sorted to the family level. We identified them to the species level and examined long-term
species-specific phenological responses to recent summer warming. Two species were rare in the samples (Polaris fritillary Boloria
polaris and Arctic blue Plebejus glandon) and statistical analyses of phenological responses were therefore restricted to the
two most abundant species (Arctic fritillary, B. chariclea and Northern clouded yellow Colias hecla). Our analyses demonstrated
a trend towards earlier flight seasons in B. chariclea, but not in C. hecla. The timing of onset, peak and end of the flight season in
B. chariclea were closely related to snowmelt, July temperature and their interaction, whereas onset, peak and end of the flight
season in C. hecla were only related to timing of snowmelt. The duration of the butterfly flight season was significantly positively
related to the temporal overlap with floral resources in both butterfly species. We further demonstrate that yellow pitfall traps are
a useful alternative to transect walks for butterfly recording in tundra habitats. More phenological studies of Arctic arthropods
should be carried out at the species level and ideally be analysed in context with interacting species to assess how ongoing climate
change will affect Arctic biodiversity in the near future},

  abstract  = {The cultivation of genetically modified (GM) herbicide resistant oilseed rape (Brassica napus) has increased over the past few years. The transfer of herbicide resistance genes via pollen (gene flow) from GM crops to non-GM crops is of relevance for the realisation of co-existence of different agricultural cultivation forms as well as for weed management. Therefore the likelihood of pollen-mediated gene flow has been investigated in numerous studies. Despite the difficulty to compare different experiments with varying levels of outcrossing, we performed a literature search for worldwide studies on cross-fertilisation in fully fertile oilseed rape. The occurrence and frequency of pollen mediated intraspecific gene flow (outcrossing rate) can vary according to cultivar, experimental design, local topography and environmental conditions. The outcrossing rate from one field to another depends also on the size and arrangement of donor and recipient populations and on the ratio between donor and recipient plot size. The outcrossing levels specified in the presented studies are derived mostly from experiments where the recipient field is either surrounding the donor field (continuous design) or is located as a patch at different distances from the donor field (discontinuous design). Reports of gene flow in Brassica napus generally show that the amount of cross-fertilisation decreases as the distance from the pollen source increases. The evidence given in various studies reveals that the bulk of GM cross fertilisation occurs within the first 10 m of the recipient field. The removal of the first 10 m of a nontransgenic field facing a GM crop might therefore be more efficient for reducing the total level of crossfertilisation in a recipient sink population than to recommend separation distances. Future experiments should investigate cross-fertilisation with multiple adjacent donor fields at the landscape level under different spatial distributions of rapeseed cultivars and different cropping systems. The level of cross fertilisation occurring over the whole field is mainly important for co-existence and has not been investigated in agricultural scale experiments until now. Potential problems with herbicide resistant oilseed rape volunteers arising from intraspecific gene flow can be largely solved by the choice of suitable cultivars and herbicides as well as by soil management.},

  abstract  = {1. Sown wildflower strips are increasingly being established in European countries within agri-environmental schemes to enhance biodiversity, especially in intensively used agricultural areas.
2. The regulations vary between countries regarding the seed mixture, intensity of management and period of time over which subsidies are given. Insects in particular are intended to benefit from these schemes.
3. This review treats studies of insect diversity and abundance in sown wildflower strips. Schemes on wildflower strips in several countries in Central and Northern Europe are compared.
4. In a significant majority of studies, sown wildflower strips support higher insect abundances and diversity than cropped habitats. In general, numbers and diversity also tend to be higher than in other margin types such as sown grass margins and natural regeneration, but pollen- and nectar-rich flower mixtures may outperform them.
5. Common species are the main beneficiaries of the establishment of wildflower strips, although some studies point out the presence of rare or declining insect species.
6. Insect groups respond differently to particular characteristics of the strips. Flower abundance, seed mixture, vegetation structure, management, age and landscape have been identified as factors influencing insect abundance and diversity.
7. Future work should address under-represented comparisons, such as with pollen- and nectar-rich seed mixes, and neglected groups, in particular parasitoids. Nevertheless, sown wildflower strips can already be seen as a beneficial measure to enhance insect diversity. This is especially the case, where schemes for sown strips vary within a region to favour different species groups.},

  abstract  = {1. The structural complexity of agricultural landscapes influences the local biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Hence, developing effective biodiversity management requires a better understanding of the relative importance of local and landscape changes, especially for functionally important organisms such as hoverflies benefiting from flowering plants.
2. We examined hoverfly (Diptera: Syrphidae) communities in broad and narrow sown flower strips, in naturally developed grassy strips and in wheat fields (as a control). We also investigated the effects of these four habitat types on syrphid occurrence in the adjacent wheat fields.
3. The relative influence of local vs. landscape effects was tested by selecting study sites along a gradient of structural complexity from simple landscapes (~100% arable land) to complex landscapes (up to 70% semi-natural habitats such as fallows, field margins, hedges and grassland). Landscape complexity was assessed within landscape sectors of 0.5-4.0 km radius around strips.
4. Syrphid density and in particular, the density of aphidophagous species, was higher in narrow and broad sown flower strips compared to grassy strips and wheat-wheat boundary controls at the milk-ripening stage of the wheat. In addition, species richness of aphidophagous syrphids within wheat fields adjacent to broad sown flower strips was higher at the wheat peak-ripening stage. This indicates a spillover between habitats and a positive effect of these sown flower strips on potential biocontrol of cereal aphids. Flower densities and syrphid diversity and density, respectively, were closely related.
5. Species richness and abundance in the sown flower strips increased as the proportion of arable land in the surrounding landscape increased, suggesting that within structurally simple landscapes (at 0.5-1 km radius around the sites) syrphid flies concentrated on the most rewarding resources within the sown flower strips. Sown flower strips were more effective at increasing syrphid species richness and abundance in simple landscapes, presumably because the creation of flower resources made the greatest difference in such homogeneous, intensively managed arable landscapes.
6. Synthesis and applications. Agri-environment schemes should take the surrounding landscape characteristics into account when considering using sown flower strips to enhance syrphid density and diversity, and their biocontrol function, in arable landscapes. Creating locally such flower strips is more effective in simple landscapes containing a high proportion of arable land, while in complex landscapes, keeping the overall diversity is important.},

  abstract  = {Recent studies have shown that neonicotinoid insecticides have adverse effects on non-target invertebrate species. Invertebrates constitute a substantial part of the diet of many bird species duringthe breeding season and are indispensable for raising offspring. We investigated the hypothesis that the most widely used neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, has a negative impact on insectivorous bird populations. Here we show that, in the Netherlands, local population trends were significantly more negative in areas with higher surface-water concentrations of imidacloprid. At imidacloprid concentrations of more than 20 nanograms per litre, birdpopulations tended to decline by 3.5 per cent on average annually. Additional analyses revealed that this spatial pattern of decline appeared only after the introduction of imidacloprid to the Netherlands, in the mid-1990s. We further show that the recent negative relationship remains after correcting for spatial differences in land-use changes that are known to affect bird populations in farmland. Our results suggest that the impact of neonicotinoids on the natural environment is even more substantial than has recently been reported and is reminiscent of the effects of persistent insecticides in the past. Future legislation should take into account the potential cascading effects of neonicotinoids on ecosystems.},

Specific responses by bees to increased pollen availability included: longer visits to flowers; visits to more flowers within an inflorescence, including an increased frequency of revisits; an increased likelihood of grooming while the bee flew between flowers within the inflorescence; and more protracted inter-flower flights, probably because of longer grooming bouts. The particular suite of responses that a bee adopted depended on the pollen-dispensing mechanism of the plant species involved. Bees buzzed previously-unvisited Dodecatheon flowers longer than empty flowers. In contrast, pollen availability did not significantly affect the duration of visits to Lupinus flowers, which control the amount of pollen that can be removed during a single visit. Simulation results indicate that the observed movement patterns of bumble bees on Lupinus inflorescences would return the most pollen per unit of expended energy. The increased foraging efficiency resulting from facultative responses by bees to variation in pollen availability, especially changes in the frequency and intensity of grooming, could correspondingly decrease pollen dispersal between plants.},

  abstract  = {Fluid viscosity only affected ingestion rates of bumble bees (Bombus) for solutions greater than 35--40{\%} sucrose (mass of solute per mass of solution). This contrasts with previously published models based on fluid dynamics which predicted continuous depression of ingestion rates with increasing viscosity. Individual bees maintained constant lapping rates regardless of sucrose concentration (up to at least 70{\%}). The decline in ingestion rates at higher concentrations apparently resulted from the tongue not contacting liquid long enough to become saturated due to reduced capillary flow. Increasing flower depth similarly decreased the volume of liquid ingested per lap, and did not affect lapping rate. Morphologically dissimilar bees drank at different rates because glossa length affects lapping rate and volume ingested per lap, and body mass affects lapping rate. An additional species-specific component to lapping rate also influenced ingestion rates. Deviations from a regression model derived to explain ingestion rates as a function of glossa length, body mass, flower depth and liquid viscosity suggest mechanistic and behavioralaspects to flower probing time. Because of the relation between ingestion rate and liquid viscosity, the sucrose concentration maximizing a bee's rate of net energy uptake should lie between 50--65{\%}, depending primarily on specific conditions of nectar volume, inflorescence size and flight time between inflorescences.},

Peak foraging activity of workers occurred between 15 and 32 days of age in six honeybee colonies, depending on season. Whole wet body mass decreased ~40% in correlation with the transition to foraging behavior. The entire loss of mass occurred in the abdomens, with 85% of the total decrease occurring in the digestive tract exclusive of the honey crop. Maximal thorax-specific rates of oxygen consumption ($\dot{V}O_{2}$) were 10% higher.in foragers than in 8-12-day-old hive bees. The increase in thorax-specific maximal $\dot{V}O_{2}$ combined with the decrease in body mass yielded a 50% increase in mass-specific maximal $\dot{V}O_{2}$ in foragers compared to hive bees. Glycogen stores of the thorax doubled in foragers. Pyruvate kinase activities increased fivefold up to 4 days of age and thereafter remained constant. Citrate synthase activities increased tenfold up to 4 days of age and then declined in older bees. These findings suggest that physiological specializations of workers to the foraging period may be an important benefit of the temporal polyethism schedule in honeybees.},

  Abstract                 = {Figs (Ficus spp.) and their species-specific pollinators, the fig wasps (Agaonidae), have coevolved one of the most intricate interactions found in nature, in which the fig wasps, in return for pollination services, raise their offspring in the fig inflorescence. Fig wasps, however, have very short adult lives and hence are dependent on the near-continuous production of inflorescences to maintain their populations. From January to March 1998 northern Borneo suffered a very severe drought linked to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation event of 1997-1998. This caused a substantial break in the production of inflorescences on dioecious figs and led to the local extinction of their pollinators at Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia. Most pollinators had not recolonized six months after the drought and, given the high level of endemism and wide extent of the drought, some species may be totally extinct. Cascading effects on vertebrate seed dispersers, for which figs are often regarded as keystone resources, and the tree species dependent on their services are also likely. This has considerable implications for the maintenance of biodiversity under a scenario of climate change and greater climatic extremes.},

The present study examines the extent to which a small group of six species are selective in their diets and investigates the role of flower colour as a means by which such selectivity may occur. Flower feeding preferences were determined by pollen analyses of gut contents and an extensive flower sampling programme was undertaken to provide information on the relative abundances of the food resources available to the insects. Flower colours were defined by their reflectance spectra, and the inherent colour preferences of the flies were determined by field experiments in which natural flowers were simulated using painted plastic discs. The results reveal that some hoverfly species are highly selective in their pollen diets, while others have a more generalist approach to their foraging. The division of flower resources by the more selective species is shown to be dependent, at least partially, on the colours of the flowers. The findings are discussed in relation to the theories of Competition and Optimal Foraging and the 'mechanistic approach' to ecology. The use of learning models is suggested as an alternative means of investigating patterns of resource use in future research.},

  abstract  = {It is important to understand the pollination processes that generate landscape-scale gene dispersal in plants, particularly in crop plants with genetically modified (GM) varieties. In one such crop, Brassica napus, the situation is complicated by uncertainty over the relative importance of two pollen vectors, wind and insects. 
We investigated pollination in two fields of B. napus that bloomed at different times of year (April vs. July) and attracted different abundances of foraging social bees. Rates of pollen transfer were quantified by counting the pollen grains deposited on stigmas and remaining in the anthers at intervals after flower opening. 
Flowers open in April were adequately pollinated only after 5 days and only 10% received even a single bee visit. Flowers open in July received three bee visits per hour and were fully pollinated within 3 h.
Based on published measurements of airborne pollen dispersal, we estimate that wind-pollination from a hypothetical field 1 km distant could have fertilized up to 0.3% of the field's seed when bees were scarce in April but only up to 0.007% when bees were abundant in July. 
The efficiency of pollination (the proportion of pollen released from anthers that landed on receptive stigmas) was seven times greater in July (1.5%) than in April (0.2%). The relatively high efficiency of insect pollination may help to explain the evolutionary maintenance of entomophily.
Synthesis and applications. Our results begin to resolve a long-standing inconsistency among previous studies by suggesting that the susceptibility of fields of B. napus to long-distance cross-pollination by wind depends on the level of bee activity. Models for predicting GM gene flow at the landscape-scale in this crop should take this into account.},

  abstract  = {1. Does the diversity and abundance of one trophic level affect another? Several studies at the landscape level have found a positive relationship between the diversity of floral resources and the diversity and abundance of pollinators. However, little is known about the relationship between these trophic levels on a smaller spatial scale, and the importance of blossom density relative to plant species richness in predicting abundance and richness of different flower visitor groups.
2. This study used a small-scale approach to investigate how, and if, the diversity and abundance of floral resources in study plots affected the visitation activity of different flower visitor groups. During 201 observation periods between late May and mid-August 2003, 3682 visits were observed. Bumblebees (60%), muscoids (17%), syrphids (9%), and beetles (5%) were the most abundant flower visitors.
3. Regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between blossom density and plant species richness with visitation activity, including the probability of presence in plots, the visits within plots, and the visitor richness of the most abundant pollinator groups.
4. The activity of beetles, bumblebees, and muscoids was positively predicted by the variation in blossom density, while syrphid activity was better predicted by plant species richness. Overall, the models for beetles and bumblebees explained much more of the variation in activity compared with the models for the dipterans, and blossom density was a better predictor of both flower visitor richness and activity than was plant species richness.},

  abstract  = {Climate warming affects the phenology, local abundance and large-scale distribution of plants and pollinators. Despite this, there is still limited knowledge of how elevated temperatures affect plant-pollinator mutualisms and how changed availability of mutualistic partners influences the persistence of interacting species. Here we review the evidence of climate warming effects on plants and pollinators and discuss how their interactions may be affected by increased temperatures. The onset of flowering in plants and first appearance dates of pollinators in several cases appear to advance linearly in response to recent temperature increases. Phenological responses to climate warming may therefore occur at parallel magnitudes in plants and pollinators, although considerable variation in responses across species should be expected. Despite the overall similarities in responses, a few studies have shown that climate warming may generate temporal mismatches among the mutualistic partners. Mismatches in pollination interactions are still rarely explored and their demographic consequences are largely unknown. Studies on multi-species plant-pollinator assemblages indicate that the overall structure of pollination networks probably are robust against perturbations caused by climate warming. We suggest potential ways of studying warming-caused mismatches and their consequences for plant-pollinator interactions, and highlight the strengths and limitations of such approaches.},

To address several central questions in plant reproductive biology, we investigated pollen limitation in 11 plant species, including visitation and specialisation levels of all species. The female reproductive success of most species within the studied plant community was not pollen limited, but a general tradeoff between seed production and seed weight occurred as a response to supplemental pollination. In contrast to general notion, we did not find that less visited species were most pollen limited. Instead, it appears that species with high visitation rates were most pollen limited. Our study provided conflicting evidence to whether specialisation levels may affect the degree of pollen limitation within the study community. We discuss these findings in the context of recent reviews on the occurrence, causes and consequences of pollen limitation in plants. In particular, we propose that, although pollen limitation is an important phenomenon, 1) the majority of species within a plant community may not experience pollen limitation at a given moment, 2) that common notions of which plant species should experience pollen limited reproductive success do not hold true in the studied plant community, and 3) that offspring quality is as likely affected by surplus pollen loads as is the number of offspring.},

  abstract  = {Differences in the foraging behavior of B. terricola workers on white clover, Trifolium repens, were examined on previously unvisited (filled) and depleted flowers, and as a function of flower-head density.

1. The number of florets visited per unit time was independent of flower head density from 20 to at least 290 heads/m2, in part because the bees utilized more florets per head at low flower head densities, and also because they approached but rejected more flower heads at high rather than at low flower head densities.

2. Previously visited clover-heads were approached but often rejected, while unvisited heads were not rejected.

3. The bees behaved markedly different while foraging in patches of flowers which were available to all foragers, than in those which had been screened and contained on the average 3.9 times more sugar; they tendent to move through depleted areas and to concentrate in rich areas. On successive flower-head visits in depleted areas they moved more forward than backward (82% vs. 18%), while in rich areas they tended to move almost as much backward as forward 47% vs. 53%).

4. The distances of inter-head moves were approximately twice as long in depleted as in rich areas.

5. The bees visited almost as many florets per unit time in the rich as in the depleted areas (32 vs. 35 per min). But in the rich patches they probed on the average into 11.6 florets per head in contrast to only 2.3 florets per depleted head.

6. In an experiment with B. vagans workers foraging from Aconitum napellus inflorescences, the bees did not reject previously visited flowers, and they moved upward in successive flower visits on inverted as well as on unaltered inflorescences. On horizontal inflorescences they moved both right and left. The movements are not a direct response to nectar differences, nor to differences in average nectar distributions. The systematic foraging behavior on vertical inflorescences may thus be a mechanism of reducing the revisiting of just-emptied flowers.},

Apportionment of the temporal blooming niches of the component plant species varied significantly (p < .005) between the three habitats. Flowering in bogs was spread fairly evenly throughout the growing season. In woodland, flowering occurred primarily before the trees leafed out, while in disturbed habitats blooming peaked in midsummer. Wind-pollinated trees and shrubs of all three habitat types had overlapping blooms in early spring. The blooming patterns of 1972 are compared with those of a few indicator species for 1973, 1974. 1975, and early spring 1976. The three types of habitats, having different presumed selective pressures on blooming time, served as mutual controls in the analysis of blooming times from the community perspective.},

  Abstract                 = {The International Tundra Experiment {(ITEX)} was established in late 1990 at a meeting of {Arctic} tundra ecologists as a response to predictions that the human-enhanced greenhouse warming would occur earliest and most intensely at high latitudes. The initial objective of {ITEX} was to monitor phenology, growth and reproduction in major circumpolar vascular plant species in response to climate variations and environmental manipulations at sites throughout the tundra biome. The manipulations involve passive warming of tundra plots in open-top chambers {(OTCs)}, and manipulating snow depth to alter growing season length. Standard protocols were developed for measurements, experimental design and statistical analyses, and published in an {ITEX} Manual. The standard methods ensure comparable data are collected at all sites. This special issue of Global Change Biology is based on papers developed from the 6th {ITEX} Workshop, held at the University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada, 7-11 April 1995. The papers compare short-term responses (1-3 years) of common species to climate variations and manipulations at {ITEX} sites. The {OTCs} increase mean near-surface temperatures by {1-3°C} during the growing season, simulating predictions from global circulation models. All species investigated responded to the temperature increase, especially in phenology and reproductive variables. However, these short-term responses were individualistic, and no general pattern in type or magnitude of response was noted for functional types or phenology class. Responses were generally similar among sites, although the magnitude of response tended to be greater in high Arctic sites. Early snowmelt increased carbon:nutrient ratios in plants. Sustained growth and reproductive responses to warming will depend on nutrient supply, and increased carbon:nutrient ratios in litter could buffer nutrient cycling, and hence plant growth. Ongoing, long-term research at {ITEX} sites, linked to other global change initiatives, will help elucidate probable effects of climate change at the ecosystems level in {Arctic} and {Alpine} tundra.},

in honeybee toxicology have, however, raised interest on assessing sublethal effects in
free-ranging individuals. Here, we show that the sublethal effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide
are modified in magnitude by environmental interactions specific to the landscape and time of
exposure events. Field sublethal assessment is therefore context dependent and should be
addressed in a temporally and spatially explicit way, especially regarding weather and
landscape physiognomy. We further develop an analytical Effective Dose (ED) framework to
help disentangle context-induced from treatment-induced effects and thus to alleviate
uncertainty in field studies. Although the ED framework involves trials at concentrations
above the expected field exposure levels, it allows to explicitly delineating the climatic and
landscape contexts that should be targeted for in-depth higher tier risk assessment.},

I investigated how thermal environment affects the interaction between the early-blooming daffodil, Narcissus longispathus (Amaryllidaceae) and its major bee pollinator (Andrena biclor; Andrenidae), focusing simultaneously on plant and pollinator sides of the interaction. I studied fruit and seed set, flower duration, and the intrafloral thermal environment of N. longispathus, and the thermal biology, foraging behavior, and thermoregulatory ability of A. bicolor, over a 6-yr period in southeastern Spain. N. longispathus flowers from February to April, when unsuitable weather often limits pollinator activity, yet most flowers are successfully pollinated in all years and sites. Fruit set was weakly pollen limited, but among flowers setting fruit the proportion of ovules developing into seeds was not. Individual flowers lasted for 17 d on average, remaining functional during the period. On sunny days, the air inside N. longispathus flowers was significantly warmer than outside. Mean temperature excess inside flowers was as high as 8@?C, and was positively related to solar irradiance. Within flowers, air temperature was highest around the anthers; this intrafloral gradient was consistent with variation among perianth parts in radiation transmittance. Andrena bicolor foraged in N. longispathus flowering patches only on sunny days with air temperature >12@?-13@?C, and foraging behavior and flower visitation rate when temperature dependent. Bees were able to fly at relatively low thoracic temperatures (T"t"h; range 22@?-31@?C) and this was essential for successfully foraging at N. longispathus. Under the range of irradiance and air temperature found at foraging sites, A. bicolor individuals inside flowers were able to reach T"t"h suitable for flight by passive means alone. Under laboratory conditions, A. bicolor was unable to raise or otherwise regulate T"t"h by physiological means, but free-flying individuals thermoregulated behaviorally. Basking was used to raise T"t"h, and intrafloral microclimate, by influencing the proportion of foraging time devoted to basking, played an important role in thermoregulaton. Flower visitation rate was positively related to the average temperature inside visited flowers, and the probability of basking immediately after one floral visit declined with increasing flower temperature. I conclude that the favorable microclimate within N. longispathus flowers, their long duration, and the thermal biology of A. bicolor, were critical elements in this early-season pollination system.},

  abstract            = {This study examined the daily activity patterns of the pollinators of Lavandula latifolia (Labiatae), a summer-flowering, insect-pollinated evergreen shrub of Mediterranean woodlands. The question is addressed, What is the degree of matching between the daily floral cycle of L. latifolia and the daily profile of pollinating potential of its pollinator assemblage? L. latifolia open flowers and produce nectar uninterruptedly over daytime, and both flower production and nectar secretion rates are highest early in the morning and late in the afternoon. Pollen availability in the flower population, as estimated by the proportion of pollen-bearing, male-phase flowers, reaches a maximum in late afternoon, while nectar and sugar availability peak around the middle of the day. There was considerable variation both among major groups (hymenopterans, dipterans, lepidopterans), and among species within groups, in the timing of foraging at flowers. As a consequence of this, and of interspecific differences in pollen transfer effectiveness and average flight distance between consecutively visited flowers, the daytime period is not homogeneous with regard to the potential pollinating effectiveness of the pollinators active at a given time. There is not, however, a good correlation between the daily cycles of floral resource production and availability, on one hand, and of components of pollinating effectiveness, on the other. It is suggested that both the plant's and the pollinators' daily cycles largely represent independent responses to diel rhythmicity of the physical environment, and that matches and mismatches found here between daily patterns of floral resources and aspects of pollinating effectiveness are epiphenomena lacking particular adaptive significance to the plant.},

I considered frequency of pollen transfer, number of pollen grains deposited on the stigma, selection of floral sexual stage (flowers are markedly, protandrous), and patterns of flight distance between flowers. Hymenoptera deposited more pollen and more often than Lepidoptera or Diptera. The latter two groups did not differ in this respect. Interspecific variation in frequency of pollen delivery depended on differences in proportional visitation to female-stage (receptive) flowers as well as total pollen delivery to these flowers. Lepidoptera tended to fly longer distances between consecutive flowers than Hymenoptera. Hand-pollination experiments demonstrate that variation among floral visitors in reproductive services rendered may translate into differential fitness of L. latifolia plants. Nevertheless, the potential for plant specialization on specific insects is constrained by counterbalancing variation in components of pollination quality.},

Angiosperm self-incompatibility systems have been attracting increasing attention in recent years, both because of their importance in practical plant breeding and in acknowledgement of their considerable intrinsic interest as examples of cellular interaction and recognition. Progress has been made in analysing the genetics of complex multi-locus systems in certain primitive families, and the inhibition reaction itself has been more fully characterized in certain species. The review deals mainly with homomorphic, gametophytic self-incompatibility systems, concentrating on aspects of pollen-tube growth and pistil function that appear to play key roles in the discrimination between compatible and incompatible pollen. Various implications of a recently proposed hypothesis concerning the operation of gametophytic systems are also discussed.},

  abstract  = {Foraging decisions are based on a suite of choices that include energetics and physiological constraints. Although travelling farther to harvest a greater net energetic reward is beneficial, many animals opt for a smaller net reward that requires less travel. Recent discoveries of a visual basis for flower constancy in the honeybee, Apis mellifera, led us to examine older reports that colour cues are superceded by energetic considerations. Here we show that when individual bees foraged on pedicellate artificial flowers varying in colour and interfloral distance, their behaviour depended on the colours in the choice test. Colours of similar spectral reflectance (blue versus white), that would be clustered in the bee's visual colour space, elicited more visits to the closest flower when rewards were equal, but individuals travelled a greater distance to harvest a higher energetic reward when reward quality varied. Bees chose the closest flower more often when reward volume decreased while quality remained constant. Yet, even when all flowers were identical (morphology and reward), and only interfloral distance varied, bees did not always visit the closest flower. A dramatic difference was seen when the dimorphism was yellow-blue, colours quite separate in the bee colour space and known to elicit constancy behaviour. Here, bees visited the closest flower only 5% of the time, and varying reward volume did not elicit different behaviour. Animals thus display differential foraging behaviour with respect to environmental cues that must be considered when asking questions about other behavioural parameters.},

  abstract  = {Siphonogamy, the delivery of nonmotile sperm to the egg via a pollen tube, was a key innovation that allowed flowering plants (angiosperms) to carry out sexual reproduction on land without the need for water. This process begins with a pollen grain (male gametophyte) alighting on and adhering to the stigma of a flower. If conditions are right, the pollen grain germinates to produce a pollen tube. The pollen tube invades the stigma and grows through the style towards the ovary, where it enters an ovule, penetrates the embryo sac (female gametophyte) and releases two sperm cells, one of which fertilizes the egg, while the other fuses with the two polar nuclei of the central cell to form the triploid endosperm. The events before fertilization (pollen-pistil interactions) comprise a series of complex cellular interactions involving a continuous exchange of signals between the haploid pollen and the diploid maternal tissue of the pistil (sporophyte). In recent years, significant progress has been made in elucidating the molecular identity of these signals and the cellular interactions that they regulate. Here we review our current understanding of the cellular and molecular interactions that mediate the earliest of these interactions between the pollen and the pistil that occur on or within the stigma - the ‘pollen-stigma interaction’.},

Water samples were collected from nine stream sites during the 2013 growing season. The results for the 79 water samples documented similar patterns among sites for both frequency of detection and concentration (maximum:median) with clothianidin (75%, 257 ng/L:8.2 ng/L) &gt; thiamethoxam (47%, 185 ng/L:&lt;2 ng/L) &gt; imidacloprid (23%, 42.7 ng/L: &lt;2 ng/L). Neonicotinoids were detected at all nine sites sampled even though the basin areas spanned four orders of magnitude. Temporal patterns in concentrations reveal pulses of neonicotinoids associated with rainfall events during crop planting, suggesting seed treatments as their likely source.},

Nectar production per unit area per season was substantially less at Lake Hazen, 82° N, than at Churchill, {58°N.} Nectar yield in mg sugar/flower/day was higher at Lake Hazen than at Churchill in eight of the ten species for which data were obtained at both localities. There is competition between flowers for pollinators rather than among pollinators for nectar. Heliotropic flowers, notably Dryas and Papaver, focus sunlight falling on them in the region of the germ cells; it is shown that the thermal increments obtainable by black insects resting in these flowers can be important. 184 different plant species - insect species associations are reported, based on about 350 observations and 760 insect specimens; these associations fall into 9 activity categories (some into more than one), as follows: ambush (6), basking (4), flying over (20), hidden in (20), courtship behaviour (1), nectar feeding (23), ovipositing (2), pollen feeding or collecting (12), resting on or uncertain (96).

Spider densities are highly correlated with allochthonous inputs of potential prey items, predominantly chironomid midges. Large allochthonous inputs of insects potentially provide significant quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus to the developing ecosystem from the earliest stages of succession, even before a conspicuous cyanobacterial crust has formed. Spiders entrap nutrients and their possible broader role in early ecosystem development is discussed.},

  abstract  = {Niche complementarity is a commonly invoked mechanism underlying the positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, but little empirical evidence exists for complementarity among pollinator species. This study related differences in three functional traits of pollinating bees (flower height preference, daily time of flower visitation and within-flower behaviour) to the seed set of the obligate crosspollinated pumpkin Cucurbita moschata Duch. ex Poir. across a land-use intensity gradient from tropical rainforest and agroforests to grassland in Indonesia. Bee richness and abundance changed with habitat variables and we used this natural variation to test whether complementary resource use by the diverse pollinator community enhanced final yield. We found that pollinator diversity, but not abundance, was positively related to seed set of pumpkins. Bees showed species-specific spatial and temporal variation in flower visitation traits and within-flower behaviour, allowing for classification into functional guilds. Diversity of functional groups explained even more of the variance in seed set (r^2=45%) than did species richness (r^2=32%) highlighting the role of functional complementarity. Even though we do not provide experimental, but rather correlative evidence, we can link spatial and temporal complementarity in highly diverse pollinator communities to pollination success in the field, leading to enhanced crop yield without any managed honeybees.},
  comment   = {Unclear how they measured "abundance". Looks like they used number of visitors.

Interesting conclusion, that complementary use of flowers by different pollinator guilds increased seed-set. This may have been through varying physical contact with the stigma, or through temporal overlap in pollinator availability during periods of receptivity. Either way, diversity yields better seed set (at least for pumpkins).

Apis cerana and dorsata were found in this area.

For model selection, they used partial-F tests for likelihood in nlme.},

We used a cross-inoculation experiment to characterize the scales and patterns at which geographic structure has evolved in an interaction between three pine species and one ectomycorrhizal fungus species along the west coast of North America. We found substantial and contrasting patterns of geographic interaction structure for the plants and fungi. The fungi exhibited a clinal pattern of local adaptation to their host plants across the geographic range of three coastal pines. In contrast, plant growth parameters were unaffected by fungal variation, but varied among plant populations and species. Both plant and fungal performance measures varied strongly with latitude. This set of results indicates that in such widespread species interactions, interacting species may evolve asymmetrically in a geographic mosaic because of differing evolutionary responses to clinally varying biotic and abiotic factors.},

  abstract  = {Organizational researchers are increasingly interested in model ing the multilevel nature of organizational data. Although most organi zational researchers have chosen to investigate these models using traditional Ordinary Least Squares approaches, hierarchical linear models (i.e., random coefficient models) recently have been receiving increased attention. One of the key questions in using hierarchical linear models is how a researcher chooses to scale the Level-1 indepen dent variables (e.g., raw metric, grand mean centering, group mean centering), because it directly influences the interpretation of both the level-1 and level-2 parameters. Several scaling options are reviewed and discussed in light of four paradigms of multilevellcross-level research in organizational science: incremental (i.e., group variables add incremental prediction to individual level outcomes over and above individual level predictors), mediational (i.e., the influence of group level variables on individual outcomes are mediated by individual perceptions), moderational (i.e., the relationship between two individ ual level variables is moderated by a group level variable), and sepa rate (i.e., separate within group and between group models). The paper concludes with modeling recommendations for each of these paradigms and discusses the importance of matching the paradigm under which one is operating to the appropriate modeling strategy.},

  abstract  = {Agri-environment scheme habitats can support declining pollinators, but optimum approaches for deployment remain uncertain. The impact of three management treatments (project-, farm-managed and organic farming) alongside habitat type, quantity of uncropped land removed from production and spatial configuration (strips or blocks) on wild bees, butterflies and hoverflies were investigated. Pollinators were assessed on 28 sites over three years, along boundaries representing site scale (ca. 100-ha) and within project-managed (floristically enhanced grass, wild bird seed mix, insect rich cover and natural regeneration) or farm-managed wildlife habitats (typically grass margins or game cover). Project-management resulted in the creation of the most widely utilised habitats (floristically enhanced grass and wild bird seed mixtures), but these may attract wild bees away from boundaries whereas butterfly abundance (Lycaenidae and Pieridae) was enhanced along field boundaries. Organic management and spatial configuration of habitats had little impact. Proportion of uncropped land per site was positively related to Cuckoo bee, Lycaenidae and Satyridae density and butterfly species richness at site scale and on the density of several bee species, total wild bees, Pieridae and total butterflies in wildlife habitats. The mean abundance of uncropped land was 3.6% and at least double this was required to double the abundance of wild bees and butterflies. Wild bee densities were highest in field boundaries and floristically enhanced grass and positively correlated with flower cover. Butterflies sought habitats containing their larval food plants and high flower cover. Hoverflies were most abundant in the insect rich cover. Wildlife habitat in agricultural landscapes may be insufficient and additional, diverse habitats are needed to encourage pollinators.},

  abstract  = {This paper tests the proposition that a small set of plant, animal, and abiotic processes structure ecosystems across scales in time and space. Earlier studies have suggested that these key structuring processes establish a small number of dominant temporal frequencies that entrain other processes. These frequencies often differ from each other by at least an order of magnitude. If true, ecosystems therefore will have a few dominant frequencies that are endogenously driven and that are discontinuously distributed. This paper additionally tests the proposition that these structuring processes should also generate a discontinuous distribution of spatial structures coupled with the discontinuous frequencies. If that is the case, animals living in specific landscapes should demonstrate the existence of this lumpy architecture by showing gaps in the distribution of their sizes. This proved to be the case for birds and mammals of the boreal region forest and the short-grass prairie. Alternative hypotheses to explain the body mass clumps include architectural, developmental, historical, and trophic causes. These were all tested by comparing body-mass clump distributions (1) in ecosystems having different spatial structures (forest, grassland, and marine pelagic) and (2) in different animal groups having different body plans (birds and mammals) or feeding habits (carnivore, omnivore, and herbivore). The only hypothesis that could not be rejected is that the body-mass clumps are entrained by discontinuous hierarchical structures and textures of the landscape. There is evidence for at least eight distinct habitat @'quanta,@' each defined by a distinct texture at a specific range of scales. These eight quanta together cover tens of centimetres to hundreds of kilometres in space and at least months to millennia in time. There is a striking similarity, but not identity, between the clump structure of prairie and boreal animals. This indicates that many processes that form qualitative habitat structure are common to both landscapes or ecosystems, but a few are landscape specific, particularly over larger scales. That conclusion is extended to all terrestrial ecosystems by an analysis of the body-mass clump structure of all North American birds. In contrast, there are striking differences in clump structure between landscapes and @'waterscapes,@' indicating that fundamentally different processes shape structure in terrestrial and open ocean systems. The discontinuous body-mass structure provides a bioassay of discontinuous ecosystem structure. Mammalian carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores all show the same number of body-mass clumps, and the gaps in these distributions occur at the same body masses. Mammals and birds show the same number of body-mass clumps, but the mass gaps for mammals occur at larger sizes than those for birds in such a way that the log-transformed body-mass gaps for mammals are correlated linearly with those for birds. Hence there is a simple cross-calibration between the mammal and bird bioassays. I compiled and analyzed published data on home ranges in order to convert body masses into an absolute linear measure of geometric structures in the landscape. A new and general equation was developed relating home-range size to body mass, and was tested by reanalyzing published data for mammalian carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores and for birds. I conclude: (1) Birds and mammals of all trophic levels utilize resources in their foraging areas in the same way by measuring the spatial grain of habitat patches with a resolution defined as a function of their size (i.e., the animal's step length or minimum unit of measurement). The step length is a morphological function of the size of animals and is not significantly affected by trophic status or taxonomy of the groups considered. That explains why all trophic levels and both birds and mammals show the same qualitative body-mass clump structure. (2) Home-range data can convert the body-mass data to a quantitative estimate of texture, i.e., of fractal dimension of the landscape. The landscape forms a hierarchy that contains breaks in object sizes, object proximities, and textures at particular scales. Animals also demonstrate a hierarchy of decisions whose target suddenly shifts at specific scales in space and time. The interaction between these two hierarchies produces the discontinuous body-mass clump structure. The breaks in geometry in the landscape occur because structuring processes exert their influence over defined ranges of scale. The temporal and architectural structure of habitat quanta are in general determined by three classes of processes, each dominating over three different ranges of scale. Vegetative processes that determine plant growth, plant form, and soil structure dominate the formation of texture at fine microscales of centimetres to tens of metres in space and days to decades in time. At the other, macroscale extreme, slow geomorphological processes dominate the formation of a topographic and edaphic structure at large scales of hundreds to thousands of kilometres and centuries to millennia. At the mesoscales in between, contagious disturbance processes such as fire, insect outbreak, plant disease, and water flow dominate the formation of patterns over spatial scales of hundreds of metres to hundreds of kilometres. In addition, the direct impacts of grazing by large herbivores and of human activities, and the indirect effects of large predators and animal disease, further transform spatial patterns over these meso-scales. These processes operate on time scales of years to decades, making them critically important in determining whether present local, regional, and global human influences will trigger a transition in vegetation types, and, if so, how rapidly. The paper provides a direction for the development of programs to evaluate, monitor, and predict ecosystem and community changes across scales. The necessary research elements include (1) models that incorporate a few scale-dependent structuring processes to allow cross-scale analysis; (2) comparative studies of different disturbed and undisturbed landscapes using the animal body-mass bioassay technique to identify critical scales of ecosystem geometry; (3) analysis of remote imagery to identify spatial discontinuities and regions of scale invariance; and (4) behavioral studies of the hierarchy of animal decisions to identify species groups vulnerable to predicted (using models) or observed (using remote imagery) changes in vegetation geometry.},

Thus Huxley calculated that the progeny of a single Aphis in the course of 10 generations, supposing all survived,would “contain more ponderable substance than five hundred millions of stout men; that is, more than the whole population of China”, (in Thompson, 1929). Checks, however, do occur and it has been the subject of much controversy to determine how these checks operate. Certain general principles-- the density-dependence concept of Smith (1955) , the competition theory of Nicholson (1933)-- have been proposed both verbally and mathematically, but because they have been based in part upon untested and restrictive assumptions they have been severelv criticized (e.g. Andrewartha and Birch 1954). These problems could be considerably clarified if we knew the mode of operation of each process that affects numbers, if we knew its basic and subsidiary components. predation, one such process, forms the subject of the present paper.},

This paper provides an overview of theoretical themes related to resource pulses. Theoretical models suggest short-term responses to a single pulse can qualitatively differ from longer-term responses. Recurrent resource pulses can alter community structure, permitting coexistence that otherwise would not occur, or hamper coexistence mechanisms effective in stable environments. For a given resource input, system responses can be more dramatic with short pulses. Resource pulses can cause transitions between alternative states. Dispersal permits species to exploit locally sporadic resource pulses and persist in environments that on average are unsuitable. All these issues are ripe for further theoretical explorations.},

  abstract  = {The effect of dispersal on population size and stability is explored for a population that disperses passively between two discrete habitat patches. Two basic models are considered. In the first model, a single population experiences density-dependent growth in both patches. A graphical construction is presented which allows one to determine the spatial pattern of abundance at equilibrium for most reasonable growth models and rates of dispersal. It is shown under rather general conditions that this equilibrium is unique and globally stable. In the second model, the dispersing population is a food-limited predator that occurs in both a source habitat (which contains a prey population) and a sink habitat (which does not). Passive dispersal between source and sink habitats can stabilize an otherwise unstable predator-prey interaction. The conditions allowing this are explored in some detail. The theory of optimal habitat selection predicts the evolutionarily stable distribution of a population, given that individuals can freely move among habitats so as to maximize individual fitness. This theory is used to develop a heuristic argument for why passive dispersal should always be selectively disadvantageous (ignoring kin effects) in a spatially heterogeneous but temporally constant environment. For both the models considered here, passive dispersal may lead to a greater number of individuals in both habitats combined than if there were no dispersal. This implies that the evolution of an optimal habitat distribution may lead to a reduction in population size; in the case of the predator-prey model, it may have the additional effect of destabilizing the interaction. The paper concludes with a discussion of the disparate effects habitat selection might have on the geographical range occupied by a species.},

In MFC fields, densities of bumblebees, solitary bees, managed honeybees and hoverflies were negatively related to the cover of MFCs in the landscape. In SNHs, densities of bumblebees declined with increasing cover of MFCs but densities of honeybees increased. The densities of all pollinators were generally unrelated to the cover of SNHs in the landscape. Although MFC fields apparently attracted pollinators from SNHs, in landscapes with large areas of MFCs they became diluted. The resulting lower densities might negatively affect yields of pollinator-dependent crops and the reproductive success of wild plants. An expansion of MFCs needs to be accompanied by pollinator-supporting practices in agricultural landscapes.},

The probability that the bee Osmia bicornis colonized trap nests in oilseed rape fields increased from 12 to 59 % when grassland was nearby, compared to fields isolated from grassland. In grasslands, the number of brood cells of O. bicornis in trap nests was 55 % higher when adjacent to oilseed rape compared to isolated grasslands. The percentage of oilseed rape pollen in the larval food was higher in oilseed rape fields and grasslands adjacent to oilseed rape than in isolated grasslands. In both oilseed rape fields and grasslands, the number of brood cells was positively correlated with the percentage of oilseed rape pollen in the larval food. We show that mass-flowering agricultural habitats—even when they are intensively managed—can strongly enhance the abundance of a solitary bee species nesting in nearby semi-natural habitats. Our results suggest that positive effects of agricultural habitats have been underestimated and might be very common (at least) for generalist species in landscapes consisting of a mixture of agricultural and semi-natural habitats. These effects might also have—so far overlooked—implications for interspecific competition and mutualistic interactions in semi-natural habitats.},

  abstract  = {Agricultural land use results in direct biodiversity decline through loss of natural habitat, but may also cause indirect cross-habitat effects on conservation areas. We conducted three landscape-scale field studies on 67 sites to test the hypothesis that mass flowering of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) results in a transient dilution of bees in crop fields, and in increased competition between crop plants and grassland plants for pollinators. Abundances of bumble-bees, which are the main pollinators of the grassland plant Primula veris, but also pollinate oilseed rape (OSR), decreased with increasing amount of OSR. This landscape-scale dilution affected bumble-bee abundances strongly in OSR fields and marginally in grasslands, where bumble-bee abundances were generally low at the time of Primula flowering. Seed set of Primula veris, which flowers during OSR bloom, was reduced by 20 per cent when the amount of OSR within 1 km radius increased from 0 to 15 per cent. Hence, the current expansion of bee-attractive biofuel crops results in transient dilution of crop pollinators, which means an increased competition for pollinators between crops and wild plants. In conclusion, mass-flowering crops potentially threaten fitness of concurrently flowering wild plants in conservation areas, despite the fact that, in the long run, mass-flowering crops can enhance abundances of generalist pollinators and their pollination service.},

negative effects of agricultural intensification on farmland biodiversity and ecosystem
services such as pollination. Farming system, landscape context and regional differences
may all influence biodiversity, but their relative impact and possible interactions
have been little explored.
2. The study was performed in three regions (150 km apart, 400-500 km^2 per region)
differing in land use intensity. Within each region, seven pairs of conventionally and
organically cultivated wheat fields (mean size 4 ha, 42 study fields) were selected to
encompass a gradient from heterogeneous to homogeneous landscapes within a 1-km
radius around each field.
3.Farming system had the greatest influence on biodiversity. Higher bee diversity,
flower cover and diversity of flowering plants were recorded in organic compared with
conventional fields. Bee diversity was related both to flower cover and diversity of
flowering plants, suggesting plant-mediated effects of the farming system.
4.Differences in bee diversity between organic and conventional fields increased with
the proportion of arable crops in the surrounding landscape, indicating that processes
at the landscape level modified the effectiveness of organic farming in promoting biodiversity.
Similar patterns for flower cover and diversity of flowering plants suggested
that landscape effects on bee diversity were mainly resource-mediated. After statistically
removing the variance explained by flower parameters, residual bee diversity
increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity.
5.Bee diversity differed between the three regions, but the effects of farming systems
and landscape context were independent of regional differences.
6.Synthesis and applications. Bee diversity in wheat fields was mainly influenced by
farming system, but an understanding of local bee diversity needs to incorporate both
landscape and regional perspectives. The consistency of the results in three regions
provides a reliable basis for management decisions. Agri-environment schemes that
promote organic farming in homogeneous landscapes where there are few remaining
flower-rich habitats could have the highest relative impact. However, while organic
farming could help to sustain pollination services by generalist bees in agricultural
landscapes, other measures are required to conserve more specialized bee species in
semi-natural habitats.},

In subtropical and temperate zones there was a significant trend for decreasing average LDT with increasing geographical latitude.

Drivers such as land use, invasions and climate change can affect pollinator diversity or species encounter rates. However, nitrogen deposition, climate warming and CO2 enrichment could interact to disrupt this crucial mutualism by altering plant chemistry in ways that alter floral attractiveness or even nutritional rewards for pollinators. Using a pumpkin model system, we show that these drivers non-additively affect flower morphology, phenology, flower sex ratios and nectar chemistry (sugar and amino acids), thereby altering the attractiveness of nectar to bumble bee pollinators and reducing worker longevity. Alarmingly, bees were attracted to, and consumed more, nectar from a treatment that reduced their survival by 22%. Thus, three of the five major drivers of global environmental change have previously unknown interactive effects on plant-pollinator mutualisms that could not be predicted from studies of individual drivers in isolation.},

However, when the mortality rate of workers depends on foraging performance, then maximization of the net rate no longer maximizes fitness. Under such conditions, the model predicts deviations from net-rate maximization (gain per unit of time) that may resemble the maximization of efficiency (gain per metabolic expenditure), as found in our earlier studies.},

An important component of this is to determine their ability to transfer pollen to stigmas which typically requires observers to wait for insects to visit focal flowers (static approach); a time-consuming process not amenable to obtaining measures for pollinating species of low local abundance. An alternative method (active approach) is to detach test flowers and present them to the targeted flower visitor. This offers a number of advantages (e.g. increased speed and flexibility), but may alter insect behaviour. We compared pollen deposition within flowering onion crops using three bee (Apoidea) and three fly (Diptera) species. The two approaches resulted in similar numbers of pollen grains being deposited onto stigmas for each insect species, thereby supporting the validity of the active as an alternative to the static approach in our test crop. The ability to rapidly assess stigmatic pollen deposition of a broad range of insects using the active approach can greatly assist assessments of pollinator contribution within plant pollinator assemblages.},

Pollen was removed from insects by pressing their bodies (excluding actively-collected pollen on bees’ hind legs) with a cube of gelatine fuchsin. In this study, there appears to be a strong correlation between mean estimated pollen counts for each insect species and previously published data recording mean number of pollen grains deposited on stigmas for the same species. Therefore, the measurement of pollen grains directly from flower-visiting insects shows potential as a quicker and easier technique to assess pollinator effectiveness as insects can be directly  collected from flowers.},

  abstract  = {A theory of gene dispersal by wind pollination can make an important contribution to understanding the viability and evolution of important plant groups in the Earth's changing landscape and it can be applied to evaluate concerns about the spread of engineered genes from genetically modified (GM) crops into conventional varieties via windborne pollen. Here, we present a model of cross-pollination between plant populations due to the wind. We perform a ‘mass budget’ of pollen by accounting for the number of pollen grains from release in the source population, dispersal from the source to the sink population by the wind, and deposition on receptive surfaces in the sink population. Our model can be parameterised for any wind-pollinated species, but we apply it to Brassica napus (oilseed rape or canola) to investigate the threat posed by wind pollination to \{GM\} confinement in agriculture. Specifically, we calculate the maximum feasible distance at which a particular level of windborne gene dispersal could be attained. This is equivalent to the separation distance between populations or fields required to achieve a given threshold of gene dispersal or adventitious \{GM\} presence. As required, model predictions of the upper bounds on levels of wind-mediated gene dispersal exceed observations from a wide range of published studies. For a level of gene dispersal below 0.9%, which is the \{EU\} threshold for \{GM\} adventitious presence, we predict that the maximum feasible distance for agricultural fields of B. napus is 1000m, regardless of field shape and direction of prevailing winds. For fields closer than 1000m, our model results do not necessarily imply that the 0.9% threshold is likely to be breached, because in this instance we have conservatively set the values of parameters where current knowledge is limited. We also predict that gene dispersal is reduced by 50% when the lag in peak flowering between the source and sink populations is 13 days, and reduced by 90% when the lag is 24 days. We identify further measurements necessary to improve the accuracy of the model predictions. Our model is valuable because it identifies the maximum feasible distance at which a particular level of windborne gene dispersal could be attained, which provides a high-confidence separation distance for a given level of gene containment.},

  abstract  = {Cross-pollination from fields of transgenic crops is of great public concern. Although cross-pollination in commercial canola (Brassica napus) fields has been empirically measured, field trials are expensive and do not identify the causes of cross-pollination. Therefore, theoretical models can be valuable because they can provide estimates of crosspollination at any given site and time. We present a general analytical model of field-to-field gene flow due to the following competing mechanisms: the wind, bees, and autonomous pollination. We parameterize the model for the particular case of field-to-field crosspollination of genetically modified (GM) canola via the wind and via bumble bees (Bombus s) and honey bees (Apis mellifera). We make extensive use of the large data set of bee densities collected during the recent U.K. Farm Scale Evaluations. We predict that canola approaches almost full seed set without pollinators and that autonomous pollination is responsible for >25% of seed set, irrespective of pollinator abundance. We do not predict the relative contribution of bees vs. the wind in landscape-scale gene flow in canola. However, under model assumptions, we predict that the maximum field-to-field gene flow due to bumble ees is 0.04% and 0.13% below the current EU limit for adventitious GM presence for winterand spring-sown canola, respectively. We predict that gene flow due to bees is ~3.1 times higher at 20% compared to 100% male-fertility, and due to the wind, 1.3 times higher at 20% compared to 100% male-fertility, for both winter- and spring-sown canola. Bumblebee mediated gene flow is ~2.7 times higher and wind-mediated gene flow ~1.7 times lower in spring-sown than in winter-sown canola, regardless of the degree of male-sterility. The model of cross-pollination due to the wind most closely predicted three previously published observations: field-to-field gene flow is low; gene flow increases with the proportion of plants that are male-sterile; and gene flow is higher in winter- than in spring-sown canola. Our results therefore suggest that the wind, not bees, is the main vector of long-distance gene flow in canola.},

In the field trial, colonies of honey bees were moved to transgenic or nontransgenic canola fields (each at least 40 hectares) during bloom and then sampled for larval survival and adult recovery, pupal weight, and hemolymph protein concentrations. No differences in larval survival, adult recovery, and pupal weight were detected between colonies placed in nontransgenic canola fields and those in transgenic canola fields. Colonies placed in the transgenic canola fields in the 2002 field experiment showed significantly higher hemolymph protein in newly emerged bees compared with those placed in nontransgenic canola field; however, this difference was not detected in the 2001 field experiment. In the semifield trial, bee larvae were artificially fed with bee-collected transgenic and nontransgenic canola pollen and returned to their original colonies. Larval survival, pupal survival, pupal weight, and hemolymph protein concentration of newly emerged adults were measured. There were no significant differences in any of the parameters measured between larvae that were fed transgenic canola pollen and those fed nontransgenic corn pollen. Results from this study suggest that transgenic canola pollen does not have adverse effects on honey bee development and that the use of transgenic canola dose not pose any threat to honey bees.},

  abstract  = {Winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is an important crop for human consumption and biofuel production and its production is increasing worldwide. It is generally assumed that cross-pollination by insects increases oilseed rape yield but testing of this has been restricted to a few rapeseed varieties and produced varying results. The present study determines whether cross-pollination benefits a number of oilseed rape varieties by comparing yield in the presence and absence of insects. Four rapeseed varieties (Sherlock, Traviata, Treffer and Visby) were used with ten individuals each in four pollination treatments: (1) supplementary hand-pollination, (2) open pollination with insects able to access the flowers, (3) wind pollination and (4) autonomous self-pollination. Across all four varieties, open and supplementary hand-pollination treatments resulted in higher fruit set, numbers of seeds per pod and seed yield compared with wind and self-pollination. The cross-pollination benefits, however, differed among rapeseed varieties: Treffer and Visby had a higher dependence on open (insects) and supplementary crosspollination than Sherlock and Traviata. Across all four varieties, seed weight compensated for reduced fruit set and was highest when plants were self-pollinated. The present results highlight the importance of considering varietal differences in crop pollination research. Information on the pollination requirements of crop varieties is required by farmers to optimize management decisions in a world of increasing agropollination deficits.},

  Abstract                 = {Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27% of them, or 48% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

  Abstract                 = {1 A metapopulation approach considers the ecology and genetics of populations as a product of local dynamics and the regional processes of migration, extinction and colonization. While conventional metapopulation theory involves species with frequent population turnover, limited migration and random extinction, it is likely that metapopulation dynamics, broadly defined as the product of local population dynamics and dispersal, is a feature of all species. 2 Theoretical metapopulation models of single species make three critical insights. First, metapopulations will consist of a shifting mosaic of local populations linked through migration with only a fraction of the available habitat patches occupied at one time. Secondly, there is a threshold number of habitats available, below which the species cannot persist because extinction exceeds colonization. Thirdly, the antagonism between selective forces acting during recolonization and population growth can influence the evolution of phenotypic traits. Unfortunately, little empirical data is available to evaluate these ideas for plants or to address the broader issue of whether processes at a regional scale add anything to our understanding of population dynamics. 3 Plants may seem particularly appropriate for metapopulation analyses as a result of their immobility, strong spatial structure and restricted dispersal. However, a review of the literature revealed a paucity of studies that explicitly adopted a metapopulation approach, particularly in terms of testing theoretical models. We argue that this is because of the difficulty of measuring parameters such as extinction, colonization and migration that are central to most metapopulation models. 4 Plants possess a number of special features that present both challenges and opportunities for the development of new insights into the biology of metapopulations. Three particular characteristics, seed dormancy, restricted dispersal and local adaptation, need to be incorporated into existing theoretical models so they more accurately reflect the dynamics of plant metapopulations. Finally, more effort is needed to incorporate the explicit spatial structure of individuals within metapopulations and to investigate the effect that dispersion has on their growth and reproduction.},

Structurally uniform groups of animals such as the Odonata do not show this distribution, but in mammal faunas it is approached.

SI frequently has been lost but rarely has been gained during angiosperm diversification, and there is no evidence that any particular system of SI, once lost, has been regained. Irreversible loss of SI systems is thought to occur because transitions to self-compatibility (SC) are accompanied by collapse of variation at the S-locus and by accumulation of loss-of-function mutations at multiple loci involved in the incompatibility response. The asymmetry in transitions implies either that SI is declining in frequency or that it provides a macroevolutionary advantage. We present a model in which the loss of SI is irreversible and species can be SI, SC but outcrossing, or predominantly selfing. Increased diversification rates of SI relative to SC taxa are required to maintain SI at equilibrium, while transition rates between states, together with state-specific diversification rates, govern the frequency distribution of breeding-system states. We review empirical studies about the causes and consequences of the loss of SI, paying particular attention to the model systems Arabidopsis and Solanum sect. Lycopersicon. In both groups, losses of SI have been recent and were accompanied by loss of most or all of the functional variation at the S-locus. Multiple loss-of-function mutations are commonly found. Some evidence indicates that mutations causing SC strongly increase the selfing rate and that SC species have lower genetic diversity than their SI relatives, perhaps causing an increase in the extinction rate.},

overlap among interacting taxa, with potential demographic consequences. Here, we examine associations between
the abiotic environment and plant-pollinator phenological synchrony using a long-term syrphid fly-flowering phenology
dataset (1992-2011). Degree-days above freezing, precipitation, and timing of snow melt were investigated as
predictors of phenology. Syrphids generally emerge after flowering onset and end their activity before the end of
flowering. Neither flowering nor syrphid phenology has changed significantly over our 20-year record, consistent
with a lack of directional change in climate variables over the same time frame. Instead we document interannual variability
in the abiotic environment and phenology. Timing of snow melt was the best predictor of flowering onset and
syrphid emergence. Snow melt and degree-days were the best predictors of the end of flowering, whereas degreedays
and precipitation best predicted the end of the syrphid period. Flowering advanced at a faster rate than syrphids
in response to both advancing snow melt and increasing temperature. Different rates of phenological advancements
resulted in more days of temporal overlap between the flower-syrphid community in years of early snow melt
because of extended activity periods. Phenological synchrony at the community level is therefore likely to be maintained
for some time, even under advancing snow melt conditions that are evident over longer term records at our
site. These results show that interacting taxa may respond to different phenological cues and to the same cues at
different rates but still maintain phenological synchrony over a range of abiotic conditions. However, our results also
indicate that some individual plant species may overlap with the syrphid community for fewer days under continued
climate change. This highlights the role of interannual variation in these flower-syrphid interactions and shows that
species-level responses can differ from community-level responses in nonintuitive ways.},

Behaviour is determined not by an optimizing algorithm but by fuzzy systems using linguistic rules derived from the information primacy hypothesis which stresses the importance of continual information gathering under conditions of uncertainty. In the model, the animal's hunger increases steadily over time and is reduced by visiting locations that may contain varying amounts of food. Uncertainty arises from three sources: (1) location novelty or ambiguity, that is, the animal is uncertain whether it has visited the same location before; (2) variation in the amounts of food in a given location; and (3) the recency of information concerning these two aspects of a given location. In complex and changing environments fresh information is likely to be more accurate than old information and consequently our model gives most weight to recently gathered information. All sources of uncertainty are reduced by visiting locations and gathering fresh information. The model is successful in simulating results from experiments investigating such phenomena as: spontaneous alternation; patrolling; the effects of hunger on the variability of learnt responses; latent learning; contrafreeloading; and behaviour following changes in food availability.},

Effects of robbing on female and male components of plant reproduction range from negative to positive. Their underlying mechanisms are diverse, including direct effects and indirect effects mediated through changes in pollination. We detail how plants may be able to deter robbers through morphological and chemical traits. For the evolutionary ecology of robbing to move beyond a phytocentric perspective, studies must also address the causes of robbing and the consequences for both robbers and pollinators. We use an energetics approach to evaluate these causes and consequences. Finally, we highlight unanswered questions in need of further research.},

2. We determined the relative importance of wild bees and managed honey bees Apis mellifera L. for crop pollination in the blueberry Vaccinium corymbosum L. system of Michigan, USA, by comparing bee communities in small, isolated blueberry fields with those in large blueberry fields (stocked with managed honey bee hives) and measuring the difference in yields of open-pollinated and pollinator-excluded clusters of flowers. We combined these assessments to calculate the contribution of bees to crop production in this system.
3. Wild bees were the dominant pollinators in small fields, comprising 58% of flower-visiting bees, whereas 97% of bees in large fields were honey bees. Large fields had four times as many bees visiting flowers than small fields, but only one-tenth as many bumble bees as small fields.
4. Levels of fruit set exceeded 85% in all fields and were similar between field sizes. Berry weight increased with flower exposure to pollinators and was positively correlated with bee abundance. Berry weights from open-pollinated flowers were twice as high in large fields compared with small fields.
5. By combining berry weight increases attributable to honey bees and wild bees in blueberry fields with measurements of the bee community adjusted for pollinator efficiency, we calculated the relative contributions of honey bees and wild bees to pollination of Michigan blueberries. We estimate that wild bees provide 82% of the pollination in small fields but only 12% of the total pollination services across this system, mostly through their secondary role in large fields.
6. Synthesis and applications. Wild bees are the primary pollinators of small blueberry fields, but these insects are at low abundance in large fields, perhaps due to a lack of nesting resources or competition for resources with honey bees. Our findings highlight the dependence of commercial fruit producers on honey bees and suggest that increasing the pollination contribution of other bees, particularly bumble bees, in large fields will require that growers adopt wild bee conservation strategies or stock their fields with managed colonies. Quantifying the contributions of managed and wild pollinating bees across the range of crop production scenarios will help to direct development of integrated crop pollination strategies to minimize the risk of pollination deficits affecting food production.},

  abstract  = {Global climate change could have profound effects on the Earth’s biota, including large redistributions of tree species and forest types. We used DISTRIB, a deterministic regression tree analysis model, to examine environmental drivers related to current forest-species distributions and then model potential suitable habitat under five climate change scenarios associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2. Potential shifts in suitable habitat for 76 common tree species in the eastern \{US\} were evaluated based on more than 100,000 plots and 33 environmental variables related to climate, soils, land use, and elevation. Regression tree analysis was used to devise prediction rules from current species-environment relationships. These rules were used to replicate the current distribution and predict the potential suitable habitat for more than 2100 counties east of the 100th meridian. The calculation of an importance value-weighted area score, averaged across the five climate scenarios, allowed comparison among species for their overall potential to be affected by climate change. When this score was averaged across all five climate scenarios, 34 tree species were projected to expand by at least 10%, while 31 species could decrease by at least 10%. Several species (Populus tremuloides, P. grandidentata, Acer saccharum, Betula papyrifera, Thuja occidentalis) could have their suitable habitat extirpated from US. Depending on the scenario, the optimum latitude of suitable habitat moved north more than 20&} # xa0;km for 38-47 species, including 8-27 species more than 200&
	#{xa0;km or into Canada. Although the five scenarios were in general agreement with respect to the overall tendencies in potential future suitable habitat, significant variations occurred in the amount of potential movement in many of the species. The five scenarios were ranked for their severity on potential tree habitat changes. Actual species redistributions, within the suitable habitat modeled here, will be controlled by migration rates through fragmented landscapes, as well as human manipulations.},

  abstract  = {Pollinator populations have suffered severe declines in many industrialised countries due to reduced floral and nesting resources, brought on by agricultural intensification. One potential method of mitigating these effects is creating flower strips. Most previous studies have shown higher pollinator abundances in flower strips, but none have been able to demonstrate increased pollinator abundances at larger spatial scales, in the surrounding agricultural landscapes. We assessed local and landscape-wide effects of flower strips on pollinator abundances, using 18 carefully selected study landscapes in southern Sweden, distributed along independent gradients of landscape heterogeneity and farming intensity. We found that flower strips were more attractive than field borders in general to bumblebees, whereas hoverflies were only attracted to flower strips from nearby field borders. Solitary bees declined with increasing distance from flower strips, but only in complex landscapes. As one of the first studies investigating effects of flower strips on pollinators across the wider landscape, we found increased abundance of bumblebees, but not solitary bees, in field borders outside the flower strips in floristically enhanced landscapes as compared with control landscapes. However, we found that higher quality and/or larger total area of flower strips within a farm was important for both bumblebees and solitary bees. Hoverfly abundance was enhanced on farms with flower strips in simple landscapes. Our results demonstrate that flower strips with rewarding plants do not only attract pollinators locally, but in addition have the potential to increase pollinator abundances across entire landscapes, and particularly in landscapes dominated by farmland.},

The identification and quantification of the pollination service provided by different taxa within the pollinator guild is a prerequisite for the successful establishment of nature conservation and crop management regimes. 
2. Wild bees and hoverflies are considered to be valuable pollinators in agricultural and natural systems. Although some information on pollination efficiency of individual
pollinator species is available, comparative studies of both taxa at different densities are rare. In the present study, the efficiency of the solitary mason bee Osmia rufa and two hoverfly species (Eristalis tenax and Episyrphus balteatus) as pollinators of oilseed rape Brassica napus was examined in a standardized caged plant breeding regime. Honeybee Apis mellifera colonies were used as a reference pollinator taxon.
3. Yield parameters responded differently to pollinator density and identity. Fruit set and number of seeds per pod increased with increasing pollinator density, although
these were stronger in the mason bee than the hoverfly treatment. Weight per 1000 seeds did not respond to any pollinator treatment, indicating that seed quality was not affected. Oilseed rape yield in the highest tested densities of both pollinator taxa resulted in yield values close to the efficiency of small honeybee colonies.
4. Hoverflies required approximately five-fold densities of the red mason bees to reach a similar fruit set and yield. Thus, mason bees are more efficient in plant breeding and managed pollination systems. Both natural pollinator taxa, however, are of potential value in open and closed crop production systems.},

Yet, whether or not pollinators disperse from semi-natural habitat elements into the adjacent agricultural matrix may to a large extent depend on the quality of this matrix and the corresponding pollinatorspecific life history traits. To investigate the effects of matrix quality on the distance decay of wild bees and hoverflies, six transects along vegetated field tracks originating at a large semi-natural main habitat and leading into the adjacent agricultural matrix were established in the Wetterau Region, central Hesse, Germany. Species richness of wild bees did not change with distance from the main habitat in landscapes with sufficient grassland cover in the surrounding landscape, but significantly declined when semi-natural grasslands where scarce and isolated in the adjacent agricultural matrix. Abundance of wild bees declined with distance regardless of matrix quality. Species richness of hoverflies did not decline with increasing distance in any landscape. Abundance even increased with distance to the main habitat independently of matrix quality. Thus, our data show that taxa of the pollinator guild may perceive landscapes quite differently. Because of their differing dispersal modes and resource requirements as compared to wild bees, hoverflies may play an important role in maintaining pollination services in agricultural landscapes unsuitable for bee species. Our results highlight the need for onsidering these taxon-specific differences when predicting the effect of landscape structure on pollinators.},

  abstract  = {Providing ample nectar and pollen, mass-flowering crops were suggested to counteract ongoing pollinator declines in modern agro-ecosystems. Lately, however, positive effects were shown to be transient and highly trait-specific within the social bumblebees. Contrary to bumblebees, solitary wild bees may benefit more sustainably from mass-flowering crops due to a better seasonal match of the mass provision of resources and their sexual reproduction. We quantified reproductive activity and reproductive output of the polylectic solitary bee Osmia rufa during and after mass-flowering in landscapes with differing amounts of oilseed rape and semi-natural habitats. Across seasons, the number of produced offspring increased with availability of oilseed rape and semi-natural habitats while brood abortion decreased with the former and parasitation with the latter. Season-specific analyses suggest that increased nest-building during mass-flowering of oilseed rape early in the season outweighs negative effects on the number of cells per nest and the percentage of parasitized cells once the mass-flowering has ceased. No effect on number of cells per nest during mass-flowering and exemplary pollen analysis indicate that oilseed rape benefits solitary bees in the form of abundant nectar for foraging flights rather than pollen for brood provisioning. Besides providing permanent forage and nesting sites, semi-natural elements seem to benefit pollinators also by mitigating negative effects of parasitation, potentially via enhanced hyperparasitism. In conclusion, O. rufa clearly benefits from mass-flowering oilseed rape. Yet, the outweighing of the negative post-flowering effects by the early benefits of oilseed rape is tightly linked to the bee's polylecty and early phenology. Thus, it remains to be tested if species unable to utilize oilseed rape due to mismatched oligolecty or later phenology suffer disproportionally from the post-flowering phase of oilseed rape.},

However, most studies on this issue focus on bees, while other invertebrate taxa are largely ignored. We investigated the pollination efficiency of the globally abundant hover fly Episyrphus balteatus on the common crop, oilseed rape (Brassica napus). The study was conducted over a period of 2 consecutive years by means of enclosure experiments at an agricultural site located in Central Hesse (Germany). E. balteatus significantly increased both seed set and yield. This effect was very constant in the 2 years, despite considerable interannual differences in total seed numbers and seed mass. It highlights the important role of hover flies as pollinators of arable crops under varying environmental conditions. In contrast to bees, the effect of E. balteatus was lower at high pollinator densities than at low pollinator densities. This suggests adverse effects of density-dependent factors on pollination efficiency at high densities. Thus, models ignoring the modulating effect of biotic interactions by generally assuming a simple positive relationship between pollinator density and pollination efficiency might not apply to a vital component of the pollinator community.},

-High densities had lower seed-set than low densities. They attribute this to changes to long-distance foraging strategies at high density.},

Climate-induced range expansions have been shown for two irruptive forest defoliators, the geometrids Operophtera brumata and Epirrita autumnata, causing more extensive forest damage in sub-Arctic Fennoscandia. Here, we document a rapid northwards expansion of a novel irruptive geometrid, Agriopis aurantiaria, into the same region, with the aim of providing insights into mechanisms underlying the recent geometrid range expansions and subsequent forest damage. Based on regional scale data on occurrences and a quantitative monitoring of population densities along the invasion front, we show that, since the first records of larval specimens in the region in 1997-1998, the species has spread northwards to approximately 70°N, and caused severe defoliation locally during 2004-2006. Through targeted studies of larval phenology of A. aurantiaria and O. brumata, as well as spring phenology of birch, along meso-scale climatic gradients, we show that A. aurantiaria displays a similar dynamics and development as O. brumata, albeit with a consistent phenological lag of 0.75-1 instar. Experiments of the temperature requirements for egg hatching and for budburst in birch showed that this phenological lag is caused by delayed egg hatching in A. aurantiaria relative to O. brumata. A. aurantiaria had a higher development threshold (LDTA.a.=4.71 °C, LDTO.b.=1.41 °C), and hatched later and in less synchrony with budburst than O. brumata at the lower end of the studied temperature range. We can conclude that recent warmer springs have provided phenological match between A. aurantiaria and sub-Arctic birch which may intensify the cumulative impact of geometrid outbreaks on this forest ecosystem. Higher spring temperatures will increase spring phenological synchrony between A. aurantiaria and its host, which suggests that a further expansion of the outbreak range of A. aurantiaria can be expected.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND Concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticides clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid were determined in arable soils from a variety of locations in England.
RESULTS In soil samples taken from the central area of fields, concentrations of clothianidin ranged from 0.02 to 13.6 ug kg-1. Thiamethoxam concentrations were between <0.02 and 1.50 ug kg-1, and imidacloprid concentrations between <0.09 and 10.7 ug kg-1. Concentrations of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were lower in soil samples taken from the edges of fields than from the centres of fields, but this difference was less pronounced for imidacloprid.
CONCLUSION This work gives a clear indication of the levels of neonicotinoids in arable soils after typical use of these compounds as seed dressings in the United Kingdom. There was evidence that imidacloprid was more persistent in the soils studied than clothianidin and thiamethoxam. As clothianidin and thiamethoxam have largely superseded imidacloprid in the United Kingdom, neonicotinoid levels were lower than suggested by predictions based on imidacloprid alone.},

  abstract  = {Aim: Primary succession in a high arctic environment was examined to determine whether the patterns conform to models based on studies in temperate regions. The location also presented an unique opportunity to examine a well preserved pre-Little Ice Age plant community and organically enriched palaeosol that are being released from the glacier along with the glacial and glaciofluvial sediments.
Locations: The main location was the recently deglaciated terrain of the Twin Glacier foreland at Alexandra Fjord, Ellesmere Island (79° N). The position of the glacier from air photos in 1959 and 1981, and periodic direct monitoring of the position of the terminus since 1980 provided good chronological control. Surveys of succession patterns were also conducted at four other sites in the Alexandra Fiord region of eastern central Ellesmere Island.Methods? Vegetation cover of mosses and vascular plants (lichens were not present) was measured in 1994 and 1995 using a stratified random design. twinspan and canonical correspondence analysis were used together to examine successional vegetation patterns in relation to a set of environmental variables. Species richness, total vegetation cover, and a combined set of soil parameters (pH, organic matter content, moisture and fine substrate) were compared between the two principal soil types, palaeosol and glaciofluvial sediment.
Results: Terrain age accounted for most of the variation in species composition over the study area. The succession followed a directional-replacement series with four main stages of dominance in at least 44 years: (1) mosses -> (2) graminoid-forb -> (3) deciduous shrub-moss -> (4) evergreen dwarf-shrub-moss. There was little difference in species richness patterns over time on the palaeosol compared with the glaciofluvial sediment. However, total vegetation cover was significantly higher on palaeosol and there was a significant difference in a combined set of soil parameters between the two soil types, which indicates that palaeosol may provide conditions more favourable for establishment and growth.
Main conclusions: Directional-replacement succession is possible in a high arctic oasis environment; however, this mode of succession is probably atypical of much more extensive high arctic environments such as polar deserts. Descriptive results from four other glacier forelands sampled in 1995 on east-central Ellesmere Island showed directional succession with no species replacement at two sites and non-directional succession without species replacement at another site. Primary succession in these high arctic sites is strongly controlled by local environmental conditions.},

We examined influences of inflorescence architecture on pollination and mating by quantifying the responses of bumblebees to three architectures and then using these observations as the basis of a model that simulated pollen dispersal. On artificial panicles, racemes, and umbels, each with 12 identical flowers, bees visited one more flower, on average, on umbels than on panicles (with racemes being intermediate). In contrast to this weak response, the consistency of foraging paths among flowers differed strongly among architectures ( raceme>panicle>umbel). The simulation model revealed limited differences in self-pollination and pollen export among the three inflorescence designs when all flowers presented and received pollen, because mating differences depended on only the number of flowers visited. In contrast, in simulations of inflorescences on which pollen receipt and presentation were segregated so as to minimize interference among flowers, the consistency of movement paths governed mating. In this case, racemes self-pollinated much less than umbels (with panicles being intermediate), and racemes exported much more pollen than umbels and panicles. These effects have diverse consequences for the evolution of inflorescence architecture, flower design, and sexual segregation.},

  abstract  = {Bees are important pollinators of numerous crops, and monitoring their abundance and diversity in commercial agricultural ecosystems is of increasing importance due to pollinator declines. In season-long field studies conducted in Pennsylvania during 2011-2013, we evaluated five different bee monitoring passive traps—three pan traps (blue, yellow, and white) and two vane traps (blue and yellow)—for their effectiveness and utility for monitoring bees in commercial apple orchards. Traps were placed prebloom and were monitored weekly until the end of crop season (mid-October). We recorded 14,770 bees comprising 118 species, 27 genera, and five families. The most abundant species were Augochlora pura (Say) (34.4% of total), Ceratina calcarata Robertson (15.5%), Bombus vagans Smith (7.8%), Bombus impatiens Cresson (6.4%), and Apis mellifera L. (4.3%). Bee abundance was highly variable among trap types across the three years and during the bloom and postbloom period. Blue vane traps were found to be the most effective trap type, with significantly higher rates of per-sample species accumulation than all other traps. Species richness estimates were highest for the blue vane and blue pan traps. This study reveals the utility and effectiveness of various traps for studying abundance and diversity of pollinator bees in commercially managed apple orchards. It also provides baseline information about the bee community found during the bloom and postbloom periods in Pennsylvania apple orchards that can be used to measure changes in bee community structure and abundance due to conservation efforts, such as reduced risk IPM programs, habitat management, and augmentation.},

For example, it would be very costly to let a mold cool down between runs and then reheat it when the same moldtemperature is required on successive runs. Therefore, even when the experiment is run using a random run order, a "completely randomized design" requiring a single error term is not obtained. There is a restriction on randomization that causes the experiment to require more than one error term in the model. The analysis of the experiment with restricted randomization often proceeds, however, as if a completely randomized design were run. This ignores the fact that the experiment inherently has a "split plot" structure. We examine properties of experiments run in this very common manner and investigate Lk experiments using two error terms. One error term is associated with setting the "hard-to-change factors" and the other represents the remaining error. We develop the expected covariance matrices for observations and for the estimated regression coefficients in experiments using a random run order and using run orders that restrict randomization partially or completely. We compare the precision of the estimators of the regression coefficients for the various run order scenarios and show that classical split-plot blocking is superior to a random run order.},

Here, we investigated how land-use intensity and the three main components of land use used on the study sites (mowing, grazing, fertilisation) affect bumblebee visitation to bird’s-foot trefoil, Lotus corniculatus, using a novel chemistry-based approach that overcomes the limitations of classical visitation monitoring. This approach uses the hydrocarbon footprints left behind by bumblebees that accumulate within the epicuticular wax of flowers. Along with land-use intensity, we investigated whether the small-scale (patch) population density and local abundance of L. corniculatus affected visitation. We found that the amount of footprints, and thus visitation, of bumblebees to L. corniculatus increased with land-use and grazing intensity while traditionally recorded visitation rates did not show such an effect. We further found that the patch density and local abundance of L. corniculatus had no effect on visitation. We conclude that bumblebee visitation to L. corniculatus increased with land use using the novel approach but emphasise that foraging decisions by bumblebees can be affected by many different parameters unrelated to the land-use intensity of a specific site.},

On territorial behavior and other factors influencing habitat distribution in birds. Acta Biotheoretica 19, 16-32] to predict how a single species will distribute itself among several patches, is often cited as an example of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). By defining the strategies and payoffs for habitat selection, this article puts the \{IFD\} concept in a more general game-theoretic setting of the “habitat selection game”. Within this game-theoretic framework, the article focuses on recent progress in the following directions: (1) studying evolutionarily stable dispersal rates and corresponding dispersal dynamics; (2) extending the concept when population numbers are not fixed but undergo population dynamics; (3) generalizing the \{IFD\} to multiple species. For a single species, the article briefly reviews existing results. It also develops a new perspective for Parker’s matching principle, showing that this can be viewed as the \{IFD\} of the habitat selection game that models consumer behavior in several resource patches and analyzing complications involved when the model includes resource dynamics as well. For two species, the article first demonstrates that the connection between \{IFD\} and \{ESS\} is now more delicate by pointing out pitfalls that arise when applying several existing game-theoretic approaches to these habitat selection games. However, by providing a new detailed analysis of dispersal dynamics for predator-prey or competitive interactions in two habitats, it also pinpoints one approach that shows much promise in this general setting, the so-called “two-species ESS”. The consequences of this concept are shown to be related to recent studies of population dynamics combined with individual dispersal and are explored for more species or more patches.},

Predictions based on maximisation of rate of energy gain, defined as net energy gained per unit time foraging, are significantly different from observed behaviour (Schmid-Hempel et al. 1985). In this paper we consider the effect of varying travel times in addition to flow rate. The predictions of an extended version of our theoretical model are confronted with experimental results obtained by Nunez (1982). Nunez found that bees filled their crops more fully for higher flows and longer travel times. We show that when the cost of carrying a load is considered, this trend can be predicted by maximising either energetic efficiency or net rate of gain. Figure 1 shows, however, that maximisation of net rate of gain can only produce an acceptable quantitative fit if unreasonably high costs are assumed to result from carrying the load. Energetic efficiency instead generates a good quantitative fit for acceptable assumptions about this cost (Fig. 2).},

We used two qualitative and quantitative pollination networks to simulate extinction patterns following three removal scenarios: random removal and systematic removal of the strongest and weakest interactors. We accounted for pollinator behaviour by including potential links into temporal snapshots (12 consecutive 2-week networks) to reflect mutualists’ ability to ‘switch’ interaction partners (re-wiring). Qualitative data suggested a linear or slower than linear secondary extinction while quantitative data showed sigmoidal decline of plant interaction strength upon removal of the strongest interactor. Temporal snapshots indicated greater stability of re-wired networks over static systems. Tolerance of generalized networks to species extinctions was high in the random removal scenario, with an increase in network stability if species formed new interactions. Anthropogenic disturbance, however, that promote the extinction of the strongest interactors might induce a sudden collapse of pollination networks.},

performed knockout simulations (random, and ranked from strongest) to test the 
stability of the networks. They did this with presence-absence and quantitative

- Their models rewired networks based on "potential rewiring" scenarios, where

  abstract  = {There is consensus that land-use change is a main driver behind the recent declines of many pollinator populations in Europe. However, it is still not adequately understood how the local resource quality and landscape composition influence pollinators, and if and how the effects vary in space and time. We analysed the influence of landscape- (2 km radius) and local scale- (50 m transects) resources on bumblebee species richness and abundance during two years in South-eastern Norway, where agriculture is highly modernised but landscapes still show limited spatial homogenization. Local flower density and species richness were strongly positively associated with bumblebee densities and species richness, but higher landscape-level flower species richness were linked to lower local bumblebee abundances. Early and late mass flowering crops had clear, but contrasting, effects. The total area of early flowering crops had a consistent negative impact on bumblebee density and species richness throughout the season, while late flowering crops had a positive impact in the beginning of the season before their bloom, suggesting a carry-over effect from previous years. The negative effects of early flowering crops could be due to competition of bumblebees with honey-bees, which are widely used in these crops. Bumblebee density and species richness were clearly negatively correlated with the total area of forest and flower-poor land use areas, including grass fields and cereals. In contrast, bumblebees were positively associated with most linear elements in the landscape (especially pasture and cropland verges), except for roads, which negatively affected bumblebee densities, possibly due to increased mortality, since the quality of the flower resources did not differ from other linear elements. Our results show that the quality and the spatial and temporal distribution of flower resources within the landscape are important drivers for bumblebees, but can create counterintuitive distribution patterns depending on the temporal and spatial resolution of the survey. Increasing flower resources in linear elements and the amount of late mass-flowering crops may be viable management measures to improve conditions for bumblebees in moderately intensified landscapes.},

These patterns may be innate, or they may be learned through the bees’ early foraging experience. To identify the innate components of foraging rules, we characterized the flight of naive bumblebees, foraging on a non-patchy “field” of randomly scattered artificial flowers with three color displays. The flowers were randomly mixed and all three flower types offered equal nectar volumes. Visited flowers were refilled with probability 0.5. Flight distances, flight durations and nectar probing durations were determined and related to the bees’ recent experiences. The naive bees exhibited area-restricted search behavior, i.e., flew shorter distances following visits to rewarding flowers than after visits to empty flowers. Additionally, flight distances during flower-type transitions were longer than flight distances between flowers of the same type. The two movement rules operated together: flight distances were longest for flights between flower types following non-rewarding visits, shortest for within-type flights following rewarding visits. An increase in flight displacement during flower-type shifts was also observed in a second experiment, in which all three types were always rewarding. In this experiment, flower-type shifts were also accompanied by an increase in flight duration. Possible relationships between flight distances, flight durations and flower-type choice are discussed.},

Population pressure is defined as the ratio between population density and the density of available resources. Socioeconomic complexity is measured by means of several correlated variables: storage-dependence, sedentism, social inequality, and use of a medium of exchange. Correlations between these variables are calculated from an ethnographic sample of 94 hunter-gatherer groups. The correlations between population pressure and socioeconomic complexity are found to be extremely high. Two major types of hunter-gatherers exist which are distinguished by a number of variables and may be termed “simple” and “complex.” Transitional groups between these two types are quite rare. It is also noted that population pressure does not arise in continental climates where famine mortality is common because of high-amplitude changes in productivity from year to year. It is argued that population pressure is a necessary and sufficient condition for and the efficient cause of socioeconomic complexity. The widespread disavowal by archaeologists of population pressure as a possible explanation for the prehistoric development of complex hunter-gatherers has no basis in ethnographic fact.},

Early studies demonstrated that carnivorous species had larger home ranges than herbivorous species of similar mass. These studies also argued that scaling relations (e.g., slopes) of the former were steeper than those of the latter and explained this in terms of the distribution of food resources, which are more uniformly distributed for most herbivores than for carnivores. In contrast to these studies, we show that scaling relations of home ranges for carnivorous mammals do not differ significantly from those of herbivorous and omnivorous species and that all three exhibit slopes that are significantly steeper than predicted on the basis of energetic requirements. We also demonstrate that home range size is constrained to fit within a polygonal constraint space bounded by lines representing energetic and/or biophysical limitations, which suggests that the log-linear relationship between home range area and mass may not be the appropriate function to compare against the energetically predicted slopes of 0.75 or 1.0. It remains unclear, however, why the slope of the relationship between home range area and body mass, whether based on raw data or on constraint lines, always exceeds that predicted by the energetic needs hypothesis.},

  abstract  = {Bees provide essential pollination services that are potentially affected both by local farm management and the surrounding landscape. To better understand these different factors, we modelled the relative effects of landscape composition (nesting and floral resources within foraging distances), landscape configuration (patch shape, interpatch connectivity and habitat aggregation) and farm management (organic vs. conventional and local-scale field diversity), and their interactions, on wild bee abundance and richness for 39 crop systems globally. Bee abundance and richness were higher in diversified and organic fields and in landscapes comprising more high-quality habitats; bee richness on conventional fields with low diversity benefited most from high-quality surrounding land cover. Landscape configuration effects were weak. Bee responses varied slightly by biome. Our synthesis reveals that pollinator persistence will depend on both the maintenance of high-quality habitats around farms and on local management practices that may offset impacts of intensive monoculture agriculture.},

Our reanalysis revealed that the distribution of organisms is consistently less extreme than the distribution of resources. This systematic deviation from the Ideal Free Distribution means organisms underuse richer sites and overuse poorer sites. We examine how deviations from the Ideal Free Distribution may arise as a consequence of discrimination constraints, competitive interactions, competitive asymmetries and travel between sites, and recommend ways in which the design of future tests of the Ideal Free Distribution may be improved.},

We examine each of the three optimality hypotheses in turn and test the ability of the model to make ecologically relevant predictions using climate, soil and vegetation data from a semi-arid woodland site in central New Mexico, USA.
* 3We find that all three of the optimality hypotheses are ecologically flawed. While we could qualitatively reproduce previously published results, model behaviour under novel conditions was highly variable and frequently unrealistic.
* 4The poor performance of the model was probably due to the inadequate treatment of water-limited transpiration in its original derivation. The theory thus requires redevelopment for ecological application, and we suggest several strands of research that could contribute to its improvement.},

  abstract  = {The impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on insect pollinators is highly controversial. Sublethal concentrations alter the behaviour of social bees and reduce survival of entire colonies. However, critics argue that the reported negative effects only arise from neonicotinoid concentrations that are greater than those found in the nectar and pollen of pesticide-treated plants. Furthermore, it has been suggested that bees could choose to forage on other available flowers and hence avoid or dilute exposure. Here, using a two-choice feeding assay, we show that the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of three of the most commonly used neonicotinoids, imidacloprid (IMD), thiamethoxam (TMX), and clothianidin (CLO), in food. Moreover, bees of both species prefer to eat more of sucrose solutions laced with IMD or TMX than sucrose alone. Stimulation with IMD, TMX and CLO neither elicited spiking responses from gustatory neurons in the bees’ mouthparts, nor inhibited the responses of sucrose-sensitive neurons. Our data indicate that bees cannot taste neonicotinoids and are not repelled by them. Instead, bees preferred solutions containing IMD or TMX, even though the consumption of these pesticides caused them to eat less food overall. This work shows that bees cannot control their exposure to neonicotinoids in food and implies that treating flowering crops with IMD and TMX presents a sizeable hazard to foraging bees.},

This assumption is shown to be wrong and at Hazen Camp (81° 49' N, 71° 18' W) those flowers most frequently visited by insects are totally or partially dependent on them for seed-set. These plants, Saxifraga oppositifolia, Dryas integrifolia, and Salix arctica, are among the most common in the region and are pollinated primarily by flies. Bumblebees are also important pollinators, and two species of Pedicularis are dependent on them for seed-set. Other species of plants, although setting seed independently, benefit from the visits of cross-pollinating insects by increased seed-set and probably by maintaining heterozygosity. Insects differ in their ability to carry and transfer pollen. Important pollen vectors imbibe nectar in ways such that they cannot help but transfer pollen. There are local differences in the seed-set of entomophilous flowers, correlated with the suitablility of the region to pollinators, and there may be competition amongst the flowers for pollinators. The biogeographical and taxonomical implications of these relationships and their possible importance in proposed {Arctic} refugia are briefly discussed.},

Ultraviolet is reflected from several yellow (insect-red) flowers, making them insect-purple.
Patterns and markings in the ultraviolet or other colors may be simple or complex, but cannot be described
as honey-guides. To insects, the high arctic flowers of the different species have more distinctive
colors and color patterns, and there are more different colors and color patterns, than there are to
humans. Most flowers have greater luminance factors than do their backgrounds so stand out as different
in color and brightness. Yellow flowers (with or without ultraviolet) are the most attractive to
insects; other colored flowers are visited by special groups of insects or when yellow flowers are not
available, or both. Color alone cannot account for the attractiveness or unattractiveness of some blooms.
Some flower visitors are found in flowers in which they would be least conspicuous, and cryptic color
changes may operate in the high arctic crab spider.},

Yet the relative contributions of these different regions in the context of current food systems have not been quantified. Here we determine the origins ("primary regions of diversity") of the crops comprising the food supplies and agricultural production of countries worldwide. We estimate the degree to which countries use crops from regions of diversity other than their own ("foreign crops"), and quantify changes in this usage over the past 50 years. Countries are highly interconnected with regard to primary regions of diversity of the crops they cultivate and/or consume. Foreign crops are extensively used in food supplies (68.7\% of national food supplies as a global mean are derived from foreign crops) and production systems (69.3\% of crops grown are foreign). Foreign crop usage has increased significantly over the past 50 years, including in countries with high indigenous crop diversity. The results provide a novel perspective on the ongoing globalization of food systems worldwide, and bolster evidence for the importance of international collaboration on genetic resource conservation and exchange.},

  abstract  = {* The relative importance of specialized and generalized plant-pollinator relationships is contentious, yet analyses usually avoid direct measures of pollinator quality (effectiveness), citing difficulties in collecting such data in the field and so relying on visitation data alone.

* We demonstrate that single-visit deposition (SVD) of pollen on virgin stigmas is a practical measure of pollinator effectiveness, using 13 temperate and tropical plant species. For each flower the most effective pollinator measured from SVD was as predicted from its pollination syndrome based on traditional advertisement and reward traits. Overall, c. 40% of visitors were not effective pollinators (range 0-78% for different flowers); thus, flower-pollinator relationships are substantially more specialized than visitation alone can reveal.

* Analyses at species level are crucial, as significant variation in SVD occurred within both higher-level taxonomic groups (genus, family) and within functional groups.

* Other measures sometimes used to distinguish visitors from pollinators (visit duration, frequency, or feeding behaviour in flowers) did not prove to be suitable proxies.

* Distinguishing between ‘pollinators’ and ‘visitors’ is therefore crucial, and true ‘pollination networks’ should include SVD to reveal pollinator effectiveness (PE). Generating such networks, now underway, could avoid potential misinterpretations of the conservation values of flower visitors, and of possible extinction threats as modelled in existing networks.},

  abstract            = {As a case study of adaptive strategies in temporally varying environments, thermoregulation in three populations of Colias butterflies along an elevation gradient in Colorado is studied in relation to the fluctuating meteorological environment. Emphasis is placed on short time scale (15-300 s) variation in air temperature and wind speed and its role in determining elevational patterns of body temperature, flight activity, and thermal stress due to overheating. A stochastic, linear filter model of an organism in a variable environment is used which views the adaptive process as the adjustment of the organism's filter. The relationship between this filter model and a transient energy balance model of the butterfly is examined to show how the thermoregulatory mechanisms of adaptation determine the filtering properties of the organism. Heat shocks at 45 C significantly decrease survivorship and fecundity in Colias. Time series analysis indicates that short-term variation in wind speed and air temperature under sunny, midday conditions is significantly greater at higher elevation sites. Negative cross-correlations between wind speed and air temperature at certain time scales amplify the probability of overheating in Colias. Simulation and field results show that Colias from higher elevation populations are more sensitive, in terms of body temperature response, to a given level of wind speed variability, because of their higher wing solar absorptivities. As a result of these factors, variation in body temperature under sunny, midday conditions is significantly greater for butterflies in higher elevation Colias populations, regardless of behavioral thermoregulation. While mean body temperatures under these conditions are 2-3 C higher for low elevation than for high elevation Colias, the maximum body temperatures experienced in these populations are similar. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that microevolution of thermoregulatory characteristics in Colias is constrained by the need to avoid high body temperatures. The differences in mean body temperatures which follow from this constraint and the elevational differences in meteorological variation may be a major factor in the elevational patterns of daily flight activity time observed in previous studies. By documenting the biological importance of thermal stress and flight activity for Colias, we can develop optimality models for thermoregulatory strategy. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive demonstration of quantitative differences in environmental variability and their consequences for differences in adaptive characteristics among animal populations. Results are discussed in relation to strategies of insect thermoregulation, the structure of the micromete-orological environment, and general principles of adaptive design in variable environments.},

  abstract  = {One of the most important ecosystem services for sustainable crop production is the mutualistic interaction between plants and animals: pollination. The international community has acknowledged the importance of a diversity of insect pollinators to support the increased demand for food brought about by predicted population increases. Insect pollination is threatened by several environmental and anthropogenic factors, and concern has been raised over a looming potential pollination crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports an approximate temperature increase ranging from 1.1-6.4°C by the end of this century. Climate change will exert great impacts on global ecosystems. A recent review has emphasized that plant-pollinator interactions can be affected by changes in climatic conditions in subtle ways. Data on the impacts of climate change on crop pollination is still limited, and no investigation has yet addressed this issue. This report aims to:
- provide a review of the literature on crop pollination, with a focus on the effects of climate change on pollinators important for global crop production
- present an overview of available data on the temperature sensitivity of crop pollinators and entomophilous crops and
- identify data needs and sampling techniques to answer questions related to effects of climate change on pollination, and make recommendations on the recording and management of pollinator interactions data. This includes important environmental variables that could be included in observational records in order to enhance the knowledge base on crop pollination and climate change.},

Open-top chambers (OTCs) were used to increase growing season temperatures by 1-2 C across a range of vascular plant communities. The warming enhanced reproductive effort and success in most species; shrubs and graminoids appeared to be more responsive than forbs. We found that the measured effects of warming on sexual reproduction were more consistently positive and to a greater degree in polar oasis compared with polar semidesert vascular plant communities. Our findings support predictions that long-term warming in the High Arctic will likely enhance sexual reproduction in tundra plants, which could lead to an increase in plant cover. Greater abundance of vegetation has implications for primary consumers - via increased forage availability, and the global carbon budget - as a function of changes in permafrost and vegetation acting as a carbon sink. Enhanced sexual reproduction in Arctic vascular plants may lead to increased genetic variability of offspring, and consequently improved chances of survival in a changing environment. Our findings also indicate that with future warming, polar oases may play an important role as a seed source to the surrounding polar desert landscape.},

  abstract  = {We investigated the connection between plant species diversity and climate by using a process-based, generic plant model. Different ‘species' were simulated by different values for certain growth-related model parameters. Subsequently, a wide range of values were tested in the framework of a ‘Monte Carlo' simulation for success; that is, the capability of each plant with these parameter combinations to reproduce itself during its lifetime. The range of successful parameter combinations approximated species diversity. This method was applied to a global grid, using daily atmospheric forcing from a climate model simulation. The computed distribution of plant ‘species' diversity compares very well with the observed, global-scale distribution of species diversity, reproducing the majority of ‘hot spot' areas of biodiversity. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the predicted pattern is very robust against changes of fixed model parameters. Analysis of the climatic forcing and of two additional sensitivity simulations demonstrated that the crucial factor leading to this distribution of diversity is the early stage of a plant's life when water availability is highly coupled to the variability in precipitation because in this stage root-zone storage of water is small. We used cluster analysis in order to extract common sets of species parameters, mean plant properties and biogeographic regions (biomes) from the model output. The successful ‘species' cannot be grouped into typical parameter combinations, which define the plant's functioning. However, the mean simulated plant properties, such as lifetime and growth, can be grouped into a few characteristic plant ‘prototypes', ranging from short-lived, fast growing plants, similar to grasses, to long-lived, slow growing plants, similar to trees. The classification of regions with respect to similar combinations of successful ‘species' yields a distribution of biomes similar to the observed distribution. Each biome has typical levels of climatic constraints, expressed for instance by the number of ‘rainy days' and ‘warm days'. The less the number of days favourable for growth, the greater the level of constraints and the less the ‘species' diversity. These results suggest that climate as a fundamental constraint can explain much of the global scale, observed distribution of plant species diversity.},

  abstract  = {There is compelling evidence that more diverse ecosystems deliver greater benefits to people, and these ecosystem services have become a key argument for biodiversity conservation. However, it is unclear how much biodiversity is needed to deliver ecosystem services in a cost-effective way. Here we show that, while the contribution of wild bees to crop production is significant, service delivery is restricted to a limited subset of all known bee species. Across crops, years and biogeographical regions, crop-visiting wild bee communities are dominated by a small number of common species, and threatened species are rarely observed on crops. Dominant crop pollinators persist under agricultural expansion and many are easily enhanced by simple conservation measures, suggesting that cost-effective management strategies to promote crop pollination should target a different set of species than management strategies to promote threatened bees. Conserving the biological diversity of bees therefore requires more than just ecosystem-service-based arguments.},

  abstract  = {Pollination is critical to fruit production, but the interactions of pollination with plant resources on a plant's reproductive and vegetative features are largely overlooked. We examined the influences of pollination, irrigation and fertilisation on the performance of almond, Prunus dulcis, in northern California. We used a full-factorial design to test for the effects of pollination limitation on fruit production and foliage variables of whole trees experiencing four resource treatments: (i) normal water and nutrients, (ii) reduced water, (iii) no nutrients, and (iv) reduced water and no nutrients. In each of these combinations, we applied three pollination treatments: hand-cross pollination, open-pollination and pollinator exclusion. Pollination strongly affected yield even under reduced water and no nutrient applications. Hand-cross pollination resulted in over 50% fruit set with small kernels, while open-pollinated flowers showed over 30% fruit set with moderate-sized kernels. Pollinator-excluded flowers had a maximum fruit set of 5%, with big and heavy kernels. Reduced water interacted with the open- and hand-cross pollination treatments, reducing yield more than in the pollinator exclusion treatment. The number of kernels negatively influenced the number of leaves, and reduced water and no nutrient applications interacted with the pollination treatments. Overall, our results indicate that the influences of pollination on fruit tree yield interact with the plant availability of nutrients and water and that excess pollination can reduce fruit quality and the production of leaves for photosynthesis. Such information is critical to understand how pollination influences fruit tree performance.},

  abstract  = {The extent of our reliance on animal pollination for world crop production for human food has not previously been evaluated and the previous estimates for countries or continents have seldom used primary data. In this review, we expand the previous estimates using novel primary data from 200 countries and found that fruit, vegetable or seed production from 87 of the leading global food crops is dependent upon animal pollination, while 28 crops do not rely upon animal pollination. However, global production volumes give a contrasting perspective, since 60% of global production comes from crops that do not depend on animal pollination, 35% from crops that depend on pollinators, and 5% are unevaluated. Using all crops traded on the world market and setting aside crops that are solely passively self-pollinated, windpollinated or parthenocarpic, we then evaluated the level of dependence on animal-mediated pollination for crops that are directly consumed by humans. We found that pollinators are essential for 13 crops, production is highly pollinator dependent for 30, moderately for 27, slightly for 21, unimportant for 7, and is of unknown significance for the remaining 9. We further evaluated whether local and landscape-wide management for natural pollination services could help to sustain crop diversity and production. Case studies for nine crops on four continents revealed that agricultural intensification jeopardizes wild bee communities and their stabilizing effect on pollination services at the landscape scale.},

Pesticides, pollutants, parasites, diseases, and malnutrition have all been linked to this problem. We consider here neurobiological, ecological, and evolutionary reasons why bees are particularly vulnerable to these environmental stressors. Central-place foraging on flowers demands advanced capacities of learning, memory, and navigation. However, even at low intensity levels, many stressors damage the bee brain, disrupting key cognitive functions needed for effective foraging, with dramatic consequences for brood development and colony survival. We discuss how understanding the relationships between the actions of stressors on the nervous system, individual cognitive impairments, and colony decline can inform constructive interventions to sustain bee populations.},

Both of these substitutes for standardized monitoring revealed stability of vegetation, which is probably attributable to the harsh conditions and the distance of the area from sources of diaspores of potential new incomers. The only evident recent vegetation changes related to climate change are associated with succession after glacial retreats. By establishing a network of permanent plots, researchers will be able to monitor immigration of new species from diversity ‘hot spots’ and from an abandoned settlement nearby. This will greatly enhance our ability to understand the effects of climate change on vegetation in the High Arctic.},

Furthermore, we present the first analyses of a substantial protein-coding data set (4.6 kb from one mitochondrial and four nuclear genes). Our results indicate that previous studies may have suffered from inflated support values due to subjective alignment of the ribosomal sequences, but apparently not from significant biases. The protein data provide independent confirmation of several earlier results, including the monophyly of non-xyelid hymenopterans, Pamphilioidea + Unicalcarida, Unicalcarida, Vespina, Apocrita, Proctotrupomorpha and core Proctotrupomorpha. The protein data confirm that Aculeata are nested within a paraphyletic Evaniomorpha, but cast doubt on the monophyly of Evanioidea. Combining the available morphological, ribosomal and protein-coding data, we examine the total-evidence signal as well as congruence and conflict among the three data sources. Despite an emerging consensus on many higher-level hymenopteran relationships, several problems remain unresolved or contentious, including rooting of the hymenopteran tree, relationships of the woodwasps, placement of Stephanoidea and Ceraphronoidea, and the sister group of Aculeata.},

* Parthenocarpy (fruit set in the absence of fertilization) is a trait which can increase fruit quantity and quality from pollinator-dependent crops by removing the need for pollination.
* Here we present a meta-analysis of studies examining the extent and effectiveness of parthenocarpy-promoting techniques (genetic modification, hormone application and selective breeding) currently being used commercially, or experimentally, on pollinator-dependent crops in different test environments (no pollination, hand pollination, open pollination).
* All techniques significantly increased fruit quantity and quality in 18 pollinator-dependent crop species (not including seed and nut crops as parthenocarpy causes seedlessness). The degree to which plants experienced pollen limitation in the different test environments could not be ascertained, so the absolute effect of parthenocarpy relative to optimal pollination could not be determined.
* Synthesis and applications. Parthenocarpy has the potential to lower a crop's demand for pollinators, whilst extending current geographic and climatic ranges of production. Thus, growers may wish to use parthenocarpic crop plants, in combination with other environmentally considerate practices, to improve food security and their economic prospects.},

  abstract  = {Climate change and habitat destruction are widely recognized as major threats to species’ survival. As a result of these anthropogenic impacts, species are often forced into novel landscapes where their persistence is difficult to predict. Knowledge of how individuals move or disperse through the landscape, choose habitat in which to settle, and produce offspring which survive to repeat the process can greatly improve our ability to predict species’ persistence. The field of behavioral landscape ecology uses a strong theoretical base to explore, often experimentally, how the behavior of a particular species is affected by heterogeneous and rapidly changing landscapes and can offer valuable insight for managing species in the face of human-induced environmental changes. When interpreted by modelers, results of landscape-level behavioral experiments can be quantified for use in predictive models. To this end, we summarize the methods and results of research using direct experimental manipulation techniques broken into the following categories: translocations, playback experiments, food resource manipulations, manipulations of reproductive success, direct manipulations of the landscape, and manipulations of predation risk. We review and place in a theoretical framework the results from this emerging body of research regarding how organisms move in and respond to different types of landscapes, both natural and human-altered. We go onto highlight the potential of each experimental method to quantify different processes, which may be useful when interpreted by modelers attempting to parameterize predictive models. Finally, we suggest future directions for experimental research that will allow for greater integration of behavioral landscape ecology and predictive modeling.},

Spring rapeseed was found to have an average blooming period from the second half of June to the beginning of July, producing 10 to 15 thousand flowers per 1 m2 during the period of 20 days. During their lifetime 10 flowers secreted ca. 4.63 mg of sugars and yielded an average of

Licosmos and Unica were the best performers. The composite hybrid cultivar Margo yielded only ca. 30 kg of sugars and as much pollen per 1 ha. All rapeseed cultivars were abundantly visited by pollinating insects, mainly by the honeybee, the latter accounting for 92% of the total number of foraging insects. At full blooming during the peak foraging hours and with fine weather an average of six foragers were found per 1 m2 of the blooming rapeseed stand. The flowers with free access of insects set pods at a rate of 44%. In the absence of insects the pod set was 37% and only 18% for the hybrid cultivar Margo. The pods resulting from free pollination contained an average of 15 seeds whereas those from covered flowers set an average of 10 seeds. Seed yield from free pollination averaged 25 q/ha.

  abstract  = {1. Over the last decades, biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has declined drastically. Initiatives to enhance biodiversity, such as agri-environment schemes, often have little effect, especially in intensively farmed landscapes. The effectiveness of conservation management may be improved by scheme implementation near high-quality habitats that can act as a source of species. We evaluated up to what distance high-quality habitats (nature reserves and artificially created flower-rich patches) affect the diversity of forbs and pollinators in intensively farmed landscapes of the Netherlands.
2. We surveyed forbs, inflorescences, bees and hover flies and estimated pollination services in transects along ditch banks extending 300 m from four nature reserves forming small islands in landscapes dominated by agriculture.
3. In a separate experiment, we surveyed inflorescences, bees and hover flies in 1500 m long transects on farmland adjacent to five newly introduced flower-rich patches and in five control transects.
4. Species density of forbs declined over the first 75 m and species density and abundance of hover flies declined over the first 125 m beyond the nature reserves. Beyond these distances, no further declines were observed. The effects of flower-rich patches were spatially limited. The species density and abundance of bees and hover flies were significantly enhanced in the flower-rich patch, but only the abundance of hover flies was enhanced up to 50 m beyond the patch.
5. Synthesis and applications. In intensively farmed areas, remnant high-quality habitats sustain more abundant and diverse pollinator and forb communities than the surrounding countryside. They do enhance biodiversity on nearby farmland but increases are spatially restricted (< 150 m) and relatively small. These habitats may therefore function only as dispersal sources for ecological restoration sites or agricultural fields under extensification schemes that are located in close proximity. Habitat restoration in intensively used farmland should therefore be implemented preferentially in the immediate vicinity of high-quality habitats. In the short term, newly created flower-rich habitats are no alternative to pre-existing seminatural habitats for the promotion of pollinators on nearby farmland.},

  abstract  = {Sown wildflower strips have been used to mitigate against the loss of farmland biodiversity e.g. as a part of agri-environmental schemes. In this four-year field experiment, conducted on six field parcels, the ability of wildflower strips to simultaneously promote the availability of pollination services (using bumblebee abundance as a proxy), species diversity (total species richness of bumblebees, butterflies and diurnal moths) and conservation (abundance of habitat specialist butterflies) was evaluated. The results showed that the first two indicators increased strongly and rapidly in wildflower strips until the third year of the experiment. The conservation indicator increased more slowly and this response was related to the forest cover of the surrounding landscape. Furthermore, the benefits of wildflower strips were largely independent of experimentally varied strip properties. It is concluded that wildflower strips are a flexible mitigation tool to promote different biodiversity targets in agricultural systems. Pollination services and species diversity can be promoted in different kinds of landscapes by ensuring local habitat quality. In the promotion of habitat specialists, landscape matrix quality is more critical.},

Patches at lower levels in the hierarchy are more simplistic and correspond to the traditional view of patches. At levels approaching the upper bounds of the hierarchy the internal structure becomes more heterogeneous and boundaries more ambiguous. At each level in the hierarchy, patch structure will be influenced by both contrast among patches as well as the degree of aggregation of patches at lower levels in the hierarchy. We apply this model to foraging theory, but it has wider applications as in the study of habitat selection, population dynamics, and habitat fragmentation. It may also be useful in expanding the realm of landscape ecology beyond the current focus on anthropocentric scales.},

  abstract  = {Landscape-wide mass-flowering of oilseed rape (canola Brassica napus) can considerably affect wild bee communities and pollination success of wild plants. We aimed to assess the impact of oilseed rape on the pollination of wild plants and bee abundance during and after oilseed-rape bloom, including effects on crop-noncrop spillover at landscape and adjacent-field scales. We focused on two shrub species (hawthorn Crataegus spp., dog rose Rosa canina) and adjacent herb flowering in forest edges, connected hedges, and isolated hedges in Lower Saxony, Germany. We selected 35 landscape circles of 1 km radius, differing in the amount of oilseed rape; 18 were adjacent to oilseed rape and 17 to cereal fields, and we quantified bee density via pan traps at all sites. Adjacent oilseed rape positively affected fruit mass and seed number per fruit of simultaneously flowering hawthorn (no effect on dog rose, which flowers after the oilseed rape bloom). At the landscape scale, oilseed rape had a negative effect on bumble bee density in the hedges during flowering due to dilution of pollinators per unit area and the consequently intensified competition between oilseed rape and wild shrubs, but a positive effect after flowering when bees moved to the hedges, which still provided resources. In contrast, positive landscape-scale effects of oilseed rape were found throughout the season in forest edges, suggesting that edges support nesting activity and enhanced food resources. Our results show that oilseed rape effects on bee abundances and pollination success in seminatural habitats depend on the spatial and temporal scale considered and on the habitat type, the wild plant species, and the time of crop flowering. These scale-dependent positive and negative effects should be considered in evaluations of landscape-scale configuration and composition of crops. Food resources provided by mass-flowering crops should be most beneficial for landscape-wide enhancement of wild bee populations if seminatural habitats are available, providing (1) nesting resources and (2) continuous flowering resources during the season.},

  abstract  = {* Agriculture now constitutes 40-50% of terrestrial land use globally. By enhancing habitat suitability and connectivity, restoration within agricultural landscapes could have a major influence on biodiversity conservation. However, habitat management within intensive agricultural landscapes may primarily boost abundances of common, highly mobile generalists, rather than vulnerable or endangered species. We studied pollinator community response to small-scale habitat restoration in the intensively farmed Central Valley of California to determine whether restoration could also promote more specialized, less common and/or less mobile species.


* Composition of pollinator communities was assessed in five experimental and 10 control (unrestored) sites before and after restoration of native plant hedgerows over an 8-year period, using a before-after control-impact design.


* We characterized bee and fly species based on functional response traits [floral specialization, habitat specialization, abundance, body size and sociality (bees only)] known to influence the response to habitat change.


* We modelled how species occurrences changed with habitat restoration over time as modulated by their response traits.


* We found that hedgerows not only significantly enhanced occurrences of native bee and syrphid fly species, but that as hedgerows matured, they had a greater positive effect on species that were more specialized in floral and nesting resources and smaller (less mobile).


* Synthesis and applications. Unlike previous studies that suggest habitat restoration in agricultural landscapes only benefits mobile, generalist species, our results suggest that small-scale habitat restoration can promote species whose traits likely render them particularly vulnerable to habitat degradation. Thus, even within highly intensive agricultural landscapes, small-scale habitat restoration can be a conservation management tool. However, tailoring habitat enhancements to promote certain species or guilds may be critical for their success as a conservation intervention in agricultural landscapes.},

  abstract  = {Many ecosystem services are delivered by organisms that depend on habitats that are segregated spatially or temporally from the location where services are provided. Management of mobile organisms contributing to ecosystem services requires consideration not only of the local scale where services are delivered, but also the distribution of resources at the landscape scale, and the foraging ranges and dispersal movements of the mobile agents. We develop a conceptual model for exploring how one such mobile-agent-based ecosystem service (MABES), pollination, is affected by land-use change, and then generalize the model to other MABES. The model includes interactions and feedbacks among policies affecting land use, market forces and the biology of the organisms involved. Animal-mediated pollination contributes to the production of goods of value to humans such as crops; it also bolsters reproduction of wild plants on which other services or service-providing organisms depend. About one-third of crop production depends on animal pollinators, while 60-90% of plant species require an animal pollinator. The sensitivity of mobile organisms to ecological factors that operate across spatial scales makes the services provided by a given community of mobile agents highly contextual. Services vary, depending on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources surrounding the site, and on biotic interactions occurring locally, such as competition among pollinators for resources, and among plants for pollinators. The value of the resulting goods or services may feed back via market-based forces to influence land-use policies, which in turn influence land management practices that alter local habitat conditions and landscape structure. Developing conceptual models for MABES aids in identifying knowledge gaps, determining research priorities, and targeting interventions that can be applied in an adaptive management context.},

Pollination services from native bees were significantly, positively related to the proportion of upland natural habitat in the vicinity of farm sites, but not to any other factor studied, including farm type, insecticide usage, field size and honeybee abundance. The scale of this relationship matched bee foraging ranges. Stability and predictability of pollination services also increased with increasing natural habitat area. This strong relationship between natural habitat area and pollination services was robust over space and time, allowing prediction of the area needed to produce a given level of pollination services by wild bees within this landscape.},

  abstract  = {Ecosystem services are critical to human survival; in selected cases, maintaining these services provides a powerful argument for conserving biodiversity. Yet, the ecological and economic underpinnings of most services are poorly understood, impeding their conservation and management. For centuries, farmers have imported colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera) to fields and orchards for pollination services. These colonies are becoming increasingly scarce, however, because of diseases, pesticides, and other impacts. Native bee communities also provide pollination services, but the amount they provide and how this varies with land management practices are unknown. Here, we document the individual species and aggregate community contributions of native bees to crop pollination, on farms that varied both in their proximity to natural habitat and management type (organic versus conventional). On organic farms near natural habitat, we found that native bee communities could provide full pollination services even for a crop with heavy pollination requirements (e.g., watermelon, Citrullus lanatus), without the intervention of managed honey bees. All other farms, however, experienced greatly reduced diversity and abundance of native bees, resulting in insufficient pollination services from native bees alone. We found that diversity was essential for sustaining the service, because of year-to-year variation in community composition. Continued degradation of the agro-natural landscape will destroy this "free” service, but conservation and restoration of bee habitat are potentially viable economic alternatives for reducing dependence on managed honey bees.},

  abstract  = {Populations of honey bees and other pollinators have declined worldwide in recent years. A variety of stressors have been
implicated as potential causes, including agricultural pesticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides, which are widely used and
highly toxic to honey bees, have been found in previous analyses of honey bee pollen and comb material. However, the
routes of exposure have remained largely undefined. We used LC/MS-MS to analyze samples of honey bees, pollen stored in
the hive and several potential exposure routes associated with plantings of neonicotinoid treated maize. Our results
demonstrate that bees are exposed to these compounds and several other agricultural pesticides in several ways
throughout the foraging period. During spring, extremely high levels of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were found in
planter exhaust material produced during the planting of treated maize seed. We also found neonicotinoids in the soil of
each field we sampled, including unplanted fields. Plants visited by foraging bees (dandelions) growing near these fields
were found to contain neonicotinoids as well. This indicates deposition of neonicotinoids on the flowers, uptake by the root
system, or both. Dead bees collected near hive entrances during the spring sampling period were found to contain
clothianidin as well, although whether exposure was oral (consuming pollen) or by contact (soil/planter dust) is unclear. We
also detected the insecticide clothianidin in pollen collected by bees and stored in the hive. When maize plants in our field
reached anthesis, maize pollen from treated seed was found to contain clothianidin and other pesticides; and honey bees in
our study readily collected maize pollen. These findings clarify some of the mechanisms by which honey bees may be
exposed to agricultural pesticides throughout the growing season. These results have implications for a wide range of largescale
annual cropping systems that utilize neonicotinoid seed treatments},

The work of bees on rape blossoms was systematic, the intensity of their work increased with the number of bees working per on surface unit (from 7 to 10 blossoms visited by one bee per minute); the blossoms visited were at the same time pollinated by the bees. 7600 to 10000 bees had to work 12 hours daily for a good pollination. In our trials this amount was reached only where the bee colonies were brought directly to the blossoming crop. It was found that it is necessary to bring at least 4 bee colonies to 1 hectare of blossoming rape. The rape blossoms secreted nectar for 2 days, one blossom excreted in all 2.28-2.55mg nectar with an average sugar content of 33-43%; the amount of saccharides secreted by one blossom ranged on average between 0.68 and 1.09mg. The total nectar production per 1 ha varied on average between 199 and 230kg, the amount of saccharides secreted per hectare ranged between 62-89kg. By pollinating the blossoms by heterogenous pollen the quality of the seeds was influenced in a positive manner; a higher and considerably more uniform germinating power and 1000-seed weight were manifested. On a plot sufficiently visited by bees by 59% more seed was obtained from an open surface than from under bag isolators. In this way the imortance of bees as rape pollinators has been proved.},

Emasculation experiments suggested that later flowering might promote cross-pollination. Thus, later flowering was advantageous for effective pollination.

  abstract            = {1 The term `density-dependence' is often applied rather loosely to a variety of aspects of local abundance. `Density' is most commonly measured as the size of a local population and/or the (average) spacing between the individuals within it. These parameters are interrelated and correlated in most natural populations. Yet species interactions and population dynamics may be affected differently by these different aspects of abundance. 
2 Field experiments were performed to test the effects of two components of local abundance on pollination in the self-incompatible annual plant, Brassica kaber. In one experiment, populations of uniform density but differing size were planted out, whilst in a second study both the density and size of populations were varied. 
3 The number of individuals in a population had no effect on pollinator visitation or subsequent seed set in either experiment. 
4 Population density, however, had strong effects on both visitation and reproductive success. 
5 The position of a plant within a population had an impact on pollinator constancy in the second experiment, but had no effect on visitation rates or reproductive success.},

I present the results of a field experiment performed on Brassica kaber, a self-incompatible annual crucifer, designed to test for the existence of density effects in pollination and to separate the two major component effects: reductions in the quantity and in the quality of pollinator services. B. kaber plants were grown in fan-shaped density arrays in six floral backgrounds chosen to manipulate pollinator foraging behavior. Pollinators visiting focal plants behaved as generalists in backgrounds of the similar-flowered Brassica hirta, behaved as floral specialists where no alternative floral resources were provided (three treatments), and displayed a mixture of behaviors in two background plantings where dissimilar flowers were available. Pollinator visitation rates to focal B. kaber plants declined sharply at low density in all backgrounds except the similar flower (B. hirta) treatment. Widely spaced plants displayed significantly reduced seed-set in all backgrounds studied. The most dramatic density effects occurred where pollinators were induced to behave as generalists, suggesting that density-related declines in pollinator quality are more important than parallel declines in the quantity of visits.},

770 m a.s.l.) at Sverdrup Pass, central Ellesmere Island, Canada. The gradients provided
substantial differences in environmental characteristics. Three of the four seasons (1990,
1991 and 1993) had more than 400 thawing degree-days (TDD) in the valley, while the
1992 season had less than 300. The granitic sites had consistently higher temperatures
than the dolomitic sites, despite their northerly aspect. Increasing elevation reduced
total degree-day accumulation (c. 40 degree-days/100 m) and length of potential growing
season. The proportion of the population producing flower buds was similar at all sites
in any given year, but there were differences among years. Production of flowers and
fruits per site, decreased with altitude along the dolomitic gradient in 1991 and 1992.
There was no difference in the number of buds or flowers produced per plant with
increasing altitude, although larger plants with multiple flowers were found only on
low elevation granitic sites. Plants from the dolomitic sites were smaller and flowered,
on average, after the site accumulated 150 degree-days, while plants on the granitic sites
were larger and bloomed after 200 degree-days. Papaver is able to grow and reproduce
over a wide range of environmental conditions and moderate climate warming would
likely promote its growth and establishment, unless other factors, especially snow-free
periods and water availability, become limiting.},

Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

However, the relationship between community structure and ecosystem functioning in natural systems is poorly understood. Here we show that habitat loss appeared to disrupt ecosystem functioning by affecting extinction order, species richness and abundance. We studied pollination by bees in a mosaic of agricultural and natural habitats in California and dung burial by dung beetles on recently created islands in Venezuela. We found that large-bodied bee and beetle species tended to be both most extinction-prone and most functionally efficient, contributing to rapid functional loss. Simulations confirmed that extinction order led to greater disruption of function than predicted by random species loss. Total abundance declined with richness and also appeared to contribute to loss of function. We demonstrate conceptually and empirically how the non-random response of communities to disturbance can have unexpectedly large functional consequences.},

We present contrary evidence: the number of tree species on 26 large (17-7401 km<sup>2</sup>) areas of moist temperate forest show continental differences unrelated to geographical patterns in evapotranspiration. Tree species richness of 128 samples of ca 1 ha within moist-forest biomes of the world reveal patterns of variation among continents, and with latitude, that likewise cannot be attributed to geographical patterns in evapotranspiration. We suggest an alternative, scale-dependent interpretation of the relationship between evapotranspiration and tree species richness inferred by Currie and Paquin and others from regional samples. We propose historical explanations for the dissimilarity of tree species richness among similar biomes on different continents, and for the pervasive decrease in species richness with distance from the equator.},

Bumble bees, Bombus s, are important wild pollinators that are detrimentally affected by ingestion of neonicotinoid residues. To date, imidacloprid has been the major focus of study into the effects of neonicotinoids on bumble bee health, but wild populations are increasingly exposed to alternative neonicotinoids such as thiamethoxam. To investigate whether environmentally realistic levels of thiamethoxam affect bumble bee performance over a realistic exposure period, we exposed queenless microcolonies of Bombus terrestris L. workers to a wide range of dosages up to 98 ug kg-1 in dietary syrup for 17 days. Results showed that bumble bee workers survived fewer days when presented with syrup dosed at 98ug thiamethoxam kg-1, while production of brood (eggs and larvae) and consumption of syrup and pollen in microcolonies were significantly reduced by thiamethoxam only at the two highest concentrations (39, 98ug kg-1). In contrast, we found no detectable effect of thiamethoxam at levels typically found in the nectars of treated crops (between 1 and 11ug kg-1). By comparison with published data, we demonstrate that during an exposure to field-realistic concentrations lasting approximately two weeks, brood production in worker bumble bees is more sensitive to imidacloprid than thiamethoxam. We speculate that differential sensitivity arises because imidacloprid produces a stronger repression of feeding in bumble bees than thiamethoxam, which imposes a greater nutrient limitation on production of brood.},

biodiversity by pollinating numerous plant species whose fertilisation requires
an obligatory pollinator. Apis mellifera is a species that has shown great adaptive
potential, as it is found almost everywhere in the world and in highly diverse
climates. In a context of climate change, the variability of the honey bee’s lifehistory
traits as regards temperature and the environment shows that the
species possesses such plasticity and genetic variability that this could give rise
to the selection of development cycles suited to new environmental conditions.
Although we do not know the precise impact of potential environmental changes
on honey bees as a result of climate change, there is a large body of data at our
disposal indicating that environmental changes have a direct influence on honey
bee development. In this article, the authors examine the potential impact of
climate change on honey bee behaviour, physiology and distribution, as well as
on the evolution of the honey bee’s interaction with diseases.
Conservation measures will be needed to prevent the loss of this rich genetic
diversity of honey bees and to preserve ecotypes that are so valuable for world
biodiversity},

  abstract  = {We investigated the influence of the landscape structure on solitary bee abundance and species richness in an agricultural area of western France. We focused on the role of semi-natural habitats, oilseed rape (OSR) and other crops. Our originality was to consider not only the spatial heterogeneity of the crop field mosaic but also its temporal heterogeneity through the crop rotations. Solitary bees were caught with colored pan traps in 15 margins of \{OSR\} fields and 35 margins of non-OSR fields. We found that solitary bee abundance and species richness were higher in margins of \{OSR\} fields than in margins of non-OSR fields, showing that early spring-flying species widely use this mass flowering crop. However the high number of rare species in margins of non-OSR fields (21 species recorded exclusively in these margins) highlighted the importance of these margins for the conservation of solitary bee diversity. The influence of the landscape context on solitary bees showed contrasted results according to the type of margin and the spatial scale. At the finest spatial scale, abundance in margins of \{OSR\} fields increased with increasing proportion of non-flowering crops (cereals and temporary grasslands) in the current year. At large spatial scales, solitary bee abundance in margins of non-OSR fields was positively affected by the proportion of long-term grasslands. Moreover, the proportion of fields only sown with cereals during the last 5 years negatively affected abundance and species richness at the large scales whereas the proportion of mixed fields (at least 1 year of grassland in the rotation) had a positive effect on species richness. We showed that accounting for the cumulative effects of field cover and management through the crop rotations is relevant for studying solitary bee communities. The introduction of less intensive covers, such as temporary grasslands, in cereal rotations positively influences these communities.},

  abstract            = {We consider hierarchical generalized linear models which allow extra error components in the linear predictors of generalized linear models. The distribution of these components is not restricted to be normal; this allows a broader class of models, which includes generalized linear mixed models. We use a generalization of Henderson's joint likelihood, called a hierarchical or h-likelihood, for inferences from hierarchical generalized linear models. This avoids the integration that is necessary when marginal likelihood is used. Under appropriate conditions maximizing the h-likelihood gives fixed effect estimators that are asymptotically equivalent to those obtained from the use of marginal likelihood; at the same time we obtain the random effect estimates that are asymptotically best unbiased predictors. An adjusted profile h-likelihood is shown to give the required generalization of restricted maximum likelihood for the estimation of dispersion components. A scaled deviance test for the goodness of fit, a model selection criterion for choosing between various dispersion models and a graphical method for checking the distributional assumption of random effects are proposed. The ideas of quasi-likelihood and extended quasi-likelihood are generalized to the new class. We give examples of the Poisson-gamma, binomial-beta and gamma-inverse gamma hierarchical generalized linear models. A resolution is proposed for the apparent difference between population-averaged and subject-specific models. A unified framework is provided for viewing and extending many existing methods.},

We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

  Abstract                 = {Bees are in decline potentially leading to reduced pollination and hence production of insect-pollinated crops in many countries. It is however still unclear whether the consequences of pollinator shortages differ among countries with different environmental and societal conditions. Here, we calculated economic gains attributed to insect (particularly bee) pollination (EVIP) as well as their contribution to the total value of crop production (vulnerability), and analyzed their temporal trends and inter-annual variability from 1991 to 2009 for each country of the European Union (EU). To understand which factors drive country-specific differences in pollinator dependency and stability of insect-dependent crop yields, we further asked whether EVIP, vulnerability and stability of yields were influenced by a country's climate, the number of wild bee species and/or managed honeybee hives per country, and (agricultural) gross domestic product (GDP). Across Europe, crop pollination by insects accounted for 14.6 [±3.3] billion \{EUR\} annually (EVIP), which equaled 12 (±0.8)% of the total economic value of annual crop production. Gains strongly varied among countries. Both \{EVIP\} and vulnerability increased (and the inter-annual variation of vulnerability decreased) significantly from the colder northern to the warmer Mediterranean \{EU\} countries, in parallel with increases in the number of wild bee species. Across years, economic importance of pollination increased in all but three \{EU\} countries. Apples were the most important insect-pollinated crop in the EU, accounting for 16% of the EU's total EVIP. Our results show that whereas dependency on insect pollination increased from the colder north to the warmer south, variation in economic gain from insect pollination decreased, indicating that Mediterranean countries had more stable yields of pollinator-dependent crops across years and thus more reliable gains from pollination services.},

The principal aim was to find out the best conditions for ensuring homogeneous yield. This is required for studies on yield losses caused by pests. Pollination greatly increased the yield of the main shoot through an increase in the number of pods and number of seeds per pod. This led to a reduced number of racemes per plant. The study of racemes at the same level suggests that a high-yielding main shoot has an inhibitory effect on floral initiation and pod development. The draining of metabolites by the main shoot induces a reduced number of seeds per pod on the highest secondary racemes. This effect practically disappears at the level of the 4th secondary raceme. At the whole plant level insect pollination has an essentially qualitative effect : it reduces variability among yield components so that maturity and yield components are more homogeneous. The 26 % increase in yield in pollinated plants (compared with unpollinated ones) is not statistically significant.},

These models suggest that: (1) the input matching rule is not dependent on the assumption that resources are consumed immediately that they enter a patch, and holds whether or not there is interference competition but not when there is an alternative source of mortality; (2) exploitation competition is fundamental to the continuous input model. Whether or not interference competition occurs can be determined in experimental situations by measuring the standing crops of resources in patches with different resource input rates; (3) interference models are not an alternative to continuous input models but represent a ‘snapshot’ of time from either continuous input or depletion models; (4) in continuous input models prey mortality is density independent in the absence of interference because all patches have the same standing crop of resources. When there is interference between consumers prey mortality is density dependent, unless the interference is extremely strong.},

However, neighborhood size and area estimates from these data incorporate several assumptions: (1) Pollinator flight distance is representative of pollen dispersal distance; (2) All pollen picked up by pollinators from one plant is deposited on the next one visited; (3) Pollinator flights between plants are random in direction; (4) Pollen-pistil compatibility is independent of the proximity of egg and pollen parents; (5) Seed viability is independent of the proximity of egg and pollen parents; (6) Seed production is independent of the proximity of seeds to the source; (7) The fitness of plants is independent of the distance between egg and pollen parent. These assumptions have been found to be unwarranted in many instances leading to the following conclusions: (1) Pollen carry-over may be considerable; (2) Pollinator flight sequences have a directional component; (3) Pollen-pistil compatibility may be lower among near-neighbors than among moderately spaced plants; (4) Seed abortion may be higher following self and near-neighbor crosses than following wide crosses; (5) Seed-set may be lower following crosses of neighboring plants than widely spaced plants; (6) Seed and seedling mortality may increase as the seed source is approached; (7) Fitness of offspring from distant crosses may be superior to that from self or near-neighbor crosses; (8) Gene flow over some distance may be higher in natural populations than in crops. There is abundant reason to believe that dispersal data underestimate gene flow. As a consequence, we may conclude that neighborhood sizes and areas are larger, there is less potential for random differentiation, there is less isolation by distance, there is less potential for geographical differentiation, and that stronger selection is needed to foster and maintain local differences than judged from dispersal data alone. Nevertheless, even if gene flow distances were twice as large as we now think, the spatial scale of gene dispersal: (1) is still small enough to allow substantial differentiation over short distances with moderate selective differentials, and (2) is too small to be a major cohesive force within a species.},

The minority species will be at a reproductive handicap because it suffers a larger percentage of heterospecific pollinations. The reproductive handicap of the minority species leads to a smaller standing crop in the next generation, which in turn enhances the minority disadvantage. This should lead to rapid exclusion of the minority species from the immediate flora. An increase in pollinator constancy to a given plant species retards the elimination of the rarer species. Pollinator preference for a given plant species may enhance or retard this progression depending on whether the minority species is preferred, since preference alters the effective frequencies of the two species. The minority disadvantage is reduced if the competing species have different habitat requirements or if they form large patches of regular size.},

Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

  abstract  = {The spatial component of environment, often neglected in modeling of ecological interactions, in general operates to increase species diversity. This arises due to the heterogeneity of the environment, but such heterogeneity can arise in an initially homogeneous environment due to what may be random initial events (e.g., colonization patterns), effects of which are magnified by species interactions. In this way, homogeneous environments may become heterogeneous and heterogeneous environments even more so. In patchy environments, distinct patches are likely to be colonized initially by different species, and thereby a kind of founder effect results whereby individual patches evolve along different paths simply as a consequence of initial colonization patterns. Species which would be unable to invade may nevertheless survive by establishing themselves early and will moreover be found in lower densities in other areas as overflow from their "safe" areas. Spatially continuous environments may evolve toward essentially patchy ones by this kind of process. Overall species richness is expected to be higher in patchy environments but to decrease as the ability of species to migrate becomes large. These results are due to patchiness per se and do not depend on the existence of several kinds of patches, a situation which will tend to reinforce these effects. 

Diversity is also increased in such environments with spatial extent due to the opportunities for fugitive-type spatio-temporal strategies. In these, local population oscillations provide the salvation for species which are for example competitively inferior or easy victims to predation but which can survive by superior migratory ability and (in patchy environments) talent for recolonization. Again, dependence is on spatial heterogeneity, in addition to temporal heterogeneity; again, this may be externally imposed or the result largely of internal processes. 

Some gross statistics for these processes, principally patch occupancy fractions, may prove useful for a simplified treatment of colonization-extinction equilibria, as in the approaches of Cohen (1970), Levins and Culver (1971), Horn and MacArthur (1972), and Slatkin (in preparation). For such considerations, however, one cannot assume independence of distributions; and the approach of Cohen (1970) and Slatkin (in preparation), which allows for consideration of covariance, is favored.},

2. In this study, we demonstrate that traplining bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) make a trade-off between minimizing travel distance and prioritizing the most rewarding feeding locations.
3. Individual bees trained to forage on five artificial flowers of equal reward value selected the shortest possible route as a trapline. After introducing a single highly rewarding flower to the array, they re-adjusted their routes visiting the most rewarding flower first provided the departure distance from the shortest possible route remained small (18%). When routes optimizing the initial rate of reward intake were much longer (42%), bees prioritized short travel distances.
4. Under natural conditions, in which individual flowers vary in nectar productivity and replenish continuously, it might pay bees to prioritize highly rewarding locations, both to minimize the overall number of flowers to visit and to beat competitors.
5. We discuss how combined memories of location and quality of resource patches could allow bees and other traplining animals to optimize their routing decisions in heterogeneous environments.},

Despite the widespread nature of this strategy, we still know little about how spatial memory develops and guides individuals toward suitable routes. Here, we investigate whether flower visitation sequences by bumblebees Bombus terrestris simply reflect the order in which flowers were discovered or whether they result from more complex navigational strategies enabling bees to optimize their foraging routes. We analyzed bee flight movements in an array of four artificial flowers maximizing interfloral distances. Starting from a single patch, we sequentially added three new patches so that if bees visited them in the order in which they originally encountered flowers, they would follow a long (suboptimal) route. Bees’ tendency to visit patches in their discovery order decreased with experience. Instead, they optimized their flight distances by rearranging flower visitation sequences. This resulted in the development of a primary route (trapline) and two or three less frequently used secondary routes. Bees consistently used these routes after overnight breaks while occasionally exploring novel possibilities. We discuss how maintaining some level of route flexibility could allow traplining animals to cope with dynamic routing problems, analogous to the well-known traveling salesman problem.},

  abstract  = {Predation has long been implicated as a major selective force in the evolution of several morphological and behavioral characteristics of animals. The importance of predation during evolutionary time is clear, but growing evidence suggests that animals also have the ability to assess and behaviorally influence their risk of being preyed upon in ecological time (i.e., during their lifetime). We develop an abstraction of the predation process in which several components of predation risk are identified. A review of the literature indicates that an animal's ability to assess and behaviorally control one or more of these components strongly influences decision making in feeding animals, as well as in animals deciding when and how to escape predators, when and how to be social, or even, for fishes, when and how to breathe air. This review also reveals that such decision making reflects apparent trade-offs between the risk of predation and the benefits to be gained from engaging in a given activity. Despite this body of evidence, several areas in the study of animal behavior have received little or no attention from a predation perspective. We identify several such areas, the most important of which is that dealing with animal reproduction. Much work also remains regarding the precise nature of the risk of predation and how it is actually perceived by animals, and the extent to which they can behaviorally control their risk of predation. Mathematical models will likely play a major role in future work, and we suggest that modelers strive to consider the potential complexity in behavioral responses to predation risk. Overall, since virtually every animal is potential prey for others, research that seriously considers the influence of predation risk will provide significant insight into the nature of animal behavior.},

A major reason for this are knowledge gaps in the contribution of pollinators to yield, which partly result from difficulties in determining area-based estimates of yield effects from insect pollination under field conditions. We have experimentally manipulated honey bee Apis mellifera densities at 43 oilseed rape Brassica napus fields over 2 years in Scandinavia. Honey bee hives were placed in 22 fields; an additional 21 fields without large apiaries in the surrounding landscape were selected as controls. Depending on the pollination system in the parental generation, the B. napus cultivars in the crop fields are classified as either open-pollinated or first-generation hybrids, with both types being open-pollinated in the generation of plants cultivated in the fields. Three cultivars of each type were grown. We measured the activity of flower-visiting insects during flowering and estimated yields by harvesting with small combine harvesters. The addition of honey bee hives to the fields dramatically increased abundance of flower-visiting honey bees in those fields. Honey bees affected yield, but the effect depended on cultivar type (p = 0.04). Post-hoc analysis revealed that open-pollinated cultivars, but not hybrid cultivars, had 11\% higher yields in fields with added honey bees than those grown in the control fields (p = 0.07). To our knowledge, this is the first whole-field study in replicated landscapes to assess the benefit of insect pollination in oilseed rape. Our results demonstrate that honey bees have the potential to increase oilseed rape yields, thereby emphasizing the importance of pollinator management for optimal cultivation of oilseed rape.},

Vegetational belts and mammalian communities underwent major reorganisation. New radiocarbon data show that the complex series of climatic changes affected the ranges of mammalian species dramatically, but in differing ways related to the ecologies of individual species. For species that ultimately went extinct, the reduction in range was a prolonged and geographically complex process taking thousands or tens of thousands of years. Recent genetic studies using ancient \{DNA\} show that this process was often accompanied by loss of genetic variation and, presumably, adaptive flexibility. Even so, some species survived for thousands of years in small, terminal refugia before finally becoming extinct - a pattern akin to the ‘extinction lag’ or ‘extinction debt’ posited for endangered modern taxa. Whether refugial species can survive to re-expand into new areas, especially in anthropogenically disturbed environments, is determined by a complex of factors and is not inevitable.},

The proposed method for representing latent variable interactions has potential advantages over extant procedures. First, the latent variable interaction is derived from the observed covariation pattern among all possible indicators of the interaction. Second, no constraints on particular estimated parameters need to be placed. Third, no recalculations of parameters are required. Fourth, model estimates are stable and interpretable. In our view, the orthogonalizing approach is technically and conceptually straightforward, can be estimated using any structural equation modeling software package, and has direct practical interpretation of parameter estimates. Its behavior in terms of model fit and estimated standard errors is very reasonable, and it can be readily generalized to other types of latent variables where nonlinearity or collinearity are involved (e.g., powered variables).},

  abstract  = {Abstract Numerous studies have focused on the probability of occurrence of gene flow between transgenic crops and their wild relatives and the likelihood of transgene escape, which should be assessed before the commercial release of transgenic crops. This review paper focuses on this issue for oilseed rape, Brassica napus L., a species that produces huge numbers of pollen grains and seeds. We analyze separately the distinct steps of gene flow: (1) pollen and seeds as vectors of gene flow; (2) spontaneous hybridization; (3) hybrid behavior, fitness cost due to hybridization and mechanisms of introgression; (4) and fitness benefit due to transgenes (e.g. herbicide resistance and Bt toxin). Some physical, biological and molecular means of transgene containment are also described. Although hybrids and first generation progeny are difficult to identify in fields and non-crop habitats, the literature shows that transgenes could readily introgress into Brassica rapa, Brassica juncea and Brassica oleracea, while introgression is expected to be rare with Brassica nigra, Hirschfeldia incana and Raphanus raphanistrum. The hybrids grow well but produce less seed than their wild parent. The difference declines with increasing generations. However, there is large uncertainty about the evolution of chromosome numbers and recombination, and many parameters of life history traits of hybrids and progeny are not determined with satisfactory confidence to build generic models capable to really cover the wide diversity of situations. We show that more studies are needed to strengthen and organize biological knowledge, which is a necessary prerequisite for model simulations to assess the practical and evolutionary outputs of introgression, and to provide guidelines for gene flow management.},

  abstract            = {I present a phenotypic model of the selection of self-fertilization that applies to any mode of self pollination. A novel factor, seed discounting-the loss of outcrossing maternal fitness accompanying an increase in self-fertilization-is introduced, and pollen discounting is reformulated. The model incorporates the effects of five principal factors-the cost of meiosis, inbreeding depression, reproductive assurance, and seed and pollen discounting. The model indicates that either complete cross- or self fertilization is selected, depending on the values of the parameters, but a number of additional factors can lead to intermediate frequencies of self-fertilization. Specific conditions for the selection of each mode of chasmogamous self-pollination and the effects of some special circumstances are derived by substituting the appropriate values of seed and pollen discounting in the general model. Geitonogamy and facilitated selfing are primarily nonadaptive by-products of mechanisms for outcrossing. Delayed selfing is most advantageous, but competing and prior selfing may be selected when structural constraints prevent delayed selfing or the prepotency of outcrossed pollen reduces seed discounting. The model predicts environmental modification of the frequency of self-fertilization and can explain the observed associations between frequent self-fertilization and both the annual habit and poor conditions for cross-pollination.},

  abstract  = {Many functional-ecological, morphological, and physiological-factors affect the occurrence of self-fertilization. Six modes of self-pollination are distinguished. These differ in whether they utilize specialized flowers, whether they involve the transfer of pollen within or between flowers, whether they are autonomous or mediated by vectors, and their timing relative to opportunities for outcrossing. The various modes of selfing are subject to different structural constraints. Prepotency, the preferential success of cross-pollen in achieving fertilizations when it competes with self-pollen, influences the frequency of selffertilization in some species. The amount of self-fertilization may depend on environmental conditions and the vector species visiting each flower and may vary among the flowers of one plant. To gain information on the prevalence of autonomous self-pollination, 66 species for which the degrees of self compatibility and autofertility (seed set in isolation) have been published were surveyed. Partially selfincompatible species (in which the seed set is lower after self-pollination than after separate outcrosses) have on average lower autofertility than self-compatible species (in which self- and cross-pollinations succeed equally well), but some partially self-incompatible species have considerable autofertility and some self-compatible species have none. A number of features of floral morphology and phenology are associated with high Autofertility Indices.},

  abstract  = {Crop pollination by bees and other animals is an essential ecosystem service. Ensuring the maintenance of the service requires a full understanding of the contributions of landscape elements to pollinator populations and crop pollination. Here, the first quantitative model that predicts pollinator abundance on a landscape is described and tested.Methods Using information on pollinator nesting resources, floral resources and foraging distances, the model predicts the relative abundance of pollinators within nesting habitats. From these nesting areas, it then predicts relative abundances of pollinators on the farms requiring pollination services. Model outputs are compared with data from coffee in Costa Rica, watermelon and sunflower in California and watermelon in New Jersey-Pennsylvania (NJPA).Key Results Results from Costa Rica and California, comparing field estimates of pollinator abundance, richness or services with model estimates, are encouraging, explaining up to 80 % of variance among farms. However, the model did not predict observed pollinator abundances on NJPA, so continued model improvement and testing are necessary. The inability of the model to predict pollinator abundances in the NJPA landscape may be due to not accounting for fine-scale floral and nesting resources within the landscapes surrounding farms, rather than the logic of our model.Conclusions The importance of fine-scale resources for pollinator service delivery was supported by sensitivity analyses indicating that the model's predictions depend largely on estimates of nesting and floral resources within crops. Despite the need for more research at the finer-scale, the approach fills an important gap by providing quantitative and mechanistic model from which to evaluate policy decisions and develop land-use plans that promote pollination conservation and service delivery.},

  abstract  = {Observation is a critical element of behavioural ecology and ethology. Here, we propose a similar set of techniques to enhance the study of the diversity patterns of invertebrate pollinators and associated plant species.
In a body of avian research, cameras are set up on nests in blinds to examine chick and parent interactions. This avoids observer bias, minimizes interference, and provides numerous other benefits including timestamps, the capacity to record frequency and duration of activities, and provides a permanent archive of activity for later analyses. Hence, we propose that small video cameras in blinds can also be used to continuously monitor pollinator activity on plants thereby capitalizing on those same benefits. This method was proofed in 2010 in the {Alpine} in BC, Canada on target focal plant species and on open mixed assemblages of plant species. Apple ipod nanos successfully recorded activity for an entire day at a time totalling 450 hours and provided sufficient resolution and field of view to both identify pollinators to recognizable taxonomic units and monitor movement and visitation rates at a scale of view of approximately 50 cm2. This method is not a replacement for pan traps or sweep nets but an opportunity to enhance these datasets with more detailed, finer-resolution data. Importantly, the test of this specific method also indicates that far more hours of observation - using any method - are likely required than most current ecological studies published to accurately estimate pollinator diversity.},

  abstract  = {The term facilitation generally describes positive interactions between plants, and a common approach in these studies is to identify a dominant plant to structure sampling. Unfortunately, whilst this field has rapidly expanded community ecology, it rarely includes other trophic levels such as insects and pollinators. Here, we combine facilitation, pollination, and reciprocity measures to explore the general hypothesis that sexual dimorphism in a benefactor plant species mediates its impact. The following three predictions were tested and supported using the gynodioecious {Alpine} cushion plant Silene acaulis (L.) Jacq.: (i) that the trait set of a gynodioecious benefactor plant varies between genders; (ii) that dimorphism changes the facilitation of other plants, arthropods, and pollinators; and (iii) that insect selectivity, particularly pollinators, reciprocally impacts the reproductive output of the two genders. Female S. acaulis cushion plants produced significantly more flowers but they were smaller than those of hermaphrodites. Hermaphrodite cushions facilitated other plant species and pollinators more effectively than females, whilst females strongly facilitated more arthropods. Finally, female plants have significantly higher reproductive output as estimated by fruit and seed production, and this was directly related to visitation rate by pollinators. Hence, this study clearly establishes the value of combining some of the common themes of pollination biology such as sexual dimorphism, floral morphology, and measuring reproduction with the study of positive plant-plant interactions.},

We found honey bees in both control and neonicotinoid-treated groups progressed almost identically through the summer and fall seasons and observed no acute morbidity or mortality in either group until the end of winter. Bees from six of the twelve neonicotinoid-treated colonies had abandoned their hives, and were eventually dead with symptoms resembling CCD. However, we observed a complete opposite phenomenon in the control colonies in which instead of abandonment, they were re-populated quickly with new emerging bees. Only one of the six control colonies was lost due to Nosema-like infection. The observations from this study may help to elucidate the mechanisms by which sub-lethal neonicotinoids exposure caused honey bees to vanish from their hives.},

The white type is most frequent at low altitudes near the coast. With increasing height above sea level, the frequency of white-flowered poppy plants decreases all over North Greenland. Heliotropic flowers follow the midnight sun for 24 h and may receive two to three times the radiation of an arrested flower, as measured by energy input per unit area. Under cloudy conditions, this heliotropic mechanism is broken, but it is resumed when the sunshine returns. Concentration of the radiation by reflection from the petals leads to increased temperature in the ovary and on the stigmatic disc. In sunshine, yellow flowers obtain a 1.4 to 1.7°C higher temperature than do white ones. The natural distribution of the two color morphs is explained as a response to different weather conditions: at sea level cloudy conditions prevail, and there is no advantage of being yellow. Higher temperature in yellow flowers may increase the vitality of the seeds produced, but production of the coloring agent costs energy, which could otherwise be used for growth. Only when the sunshine is reliable--as is the case at higher elevations inland--the marginal gain on the energy budget may pay for production of the pigment.},

  abstract  = {In an attempt to simulate the effect of a global climatic change, temperature manipulations were carried out in a natural population of Papaver radicatum from a {Low Arctic} area on Disko Island, West Greenland. The manipulations were carried out by means of {ITEX} corners, which are angular plexiglass screens placed around individual plants. The corners were placed with openings towards four directions and different microclimatic conditions were obtained. The corners increase the summer temperature to different degrees in the four directions. In addition they are windscreens and eventually accumulate snow, dependent on the wind directions.

Dataloggers in a set of corners measured temperatures at the end of one growing season and at the beginning of the next. Spring was delayed in all corners due to increased snow cover duration, especially in those facing East and North. Nevertheless, temperatures were increased in the corners during the season, and highest temperature sums were obtained in those facing South and West. No temperature increase was found in the North-facing corners. 

No effect was seen on the plants the first year after application of the ITEX corners. In the second year an increased biomass was observed in corners facing West and South
in accordance with the higher temperatures experienced in these directions. In the third biomass year plants in corners facing West decreased and those facing North slightly increased compared to previous years. After 4 years plants in corners facing West, South and East had attained significantly higher biomass than the control plants and the plants in corners facing North. 

An earlier onset of flowering was seen in the corners compared to control, and Southfacing corners had more flowers. An early onset of the growth period is an advantage to flowering, more so than increased temperatures during the season. Flowering was prolonged in the corners compared to controls, but there was a higher risk of frost damage to the flowers in the corners.},

  abstract  = {1. A quantitative parasitoid web was constructed describing the trophic relationships between the community of aphids, parasitoids and secondary parasitoids in an abandoned field in southern England. Root aphids were omitted and secondary parasitoids were associated with aphids rather than primary parasitoids. All aphids, parasitoids and trophic links were expressed in the same units (m-2). Over a 2-year period, separate webs were constructed for every month that aphids and parasitoids were active in the field.2. Twenty-six species of plants were attacked by 25 species of aphid which were parasitized by 18 species of primary parasitoids. The primary parasitoids were attacked by 28 species of secondary parasitoids, of which 18 directly attacked the still living aphid (hyperparasitoids) and 10 attacked the aphid after mummification (mummy parasitoids). The aphids were attended by three species of ants.3. Eleven webs were constructed for the months May to September 1994 and May to October 1995. Aphids and primary parasitoids were most abundant and diverse in June, and secondary parasitoids one month later.4. The ratios of the number of aphid species to the number of species of primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoid were relatively constant across webs, as was the ratio of the number of links involving hyperparasitoids and mummy parasitoids. The ratio of the total number of links to the total number of species increased with web size.5. The relative abundance of the species in the different webs was well described by a Dirichlet distribution with a common parameter. This implies a gamma distribution of aphid abundances in the field with few common and many rare species.6. Predator (i.e. parasitoid) overlap graphs were constructed to assess the potential for indirect interactions between aphids. Mummy parasitoids were the most important group linking different aphids. A quantitative overlap diagram was developed to illustrate the potential strengths of indirect linkages. Common aphid species shared few strong, indirect links via primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids, but could be strongly linked by mummy parasitoids. Symmetrical links were uncommon, and rare species were potentially strongly influenced by the presence of common aphids with which they shared parasitoids.7. Ant-attended aphids were attacked by fewer species of primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids than those species not attended by ants. Species of mummy parasitoids attack, on average, approximately twice the number of host species than species of either primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids.},

For example, a more productive environment should lead to more restricted diet in numbers of different species eaten. In a patchy environment, however, this will not apply to predators that spend most of their time searching. Moreover, larger patches are used in a more specialized way than smaller patches.},

Temperature increases due to rising greenhouse gases will be amplified in Arctic and sub{Arctic} regions, and winter warming will be enhanced relative to summer warming. Climate in large areas of high latitudes may have no analogue in current climates or those of the recent geological past. Experimental field manipulations and laboratory studies indicate that plants will exhibit complex responses in photosynthesis, growth rates, phenology and reproductive functioning due to this combination of increasing temperatures, changing seasonality and increasing levels of CO2. The resulting changes in the abundance, distribution, growth rates and production of fruit and phenology of plant species will in turn impact animal populations. In predicting what the future biota of the ‘New Arctic’ will be like and developing appropriate conservation strategies, Grinnellian niche-based approaches are likely to be insufficient, and experimental ecological studies of organism response to specific anticipated changes in climate are crucial.},

Larval development requires at least four years, with larvae overwintering four times before pupating to complete the life cycle. In an unusually cold summer pupation was retarded and some larvae extended the larval period by one year. The relative growth rate is high early in larval development but drops to a low value in the fourth year. Respiration rate shows no such decline; as a result, the production/respiration ratio of fourth instar larvae is low. The prolonged life cycle leads to coexistence of several larval generations in the soil at the same time, and a low turnover rate (production/biomass). This increases the vulnerability of larvae to predation by breeding insectivorous birds and may explain the high invertebrate biomass of some tundra soils.},

One margin strip was supplemented by eight species of flowering plants, planted between the hedgerow and the arable crop. E. balteatus was observed foraging on all eight species at this florally rich strip. A control strip had no additional floral resources other than those naturally present. E. balteatus was significantly more abundant at the rich strip over 21 trapping days. The effectiveness of each strip to retain. E. balteatus was assessed by observing and recording the time spent by paint marked individuals within each strip. The rate of dispersal of E. balteatus from each strip was determined from the percentage of marked individuals remaining in a strip over time. Data from trapping E. balteatus, and from determining their dispersal rates from the strips were used in a simple mathematical expression to show that E. balteatus were attracted into the rich strip more than the control strip on nine study days during the first half of the investigation. E. balteatus dispersed significantly more slowly from the rich strip on nine study days during the second half of the study. Managing hedgerows and fieldmargins to create florally rich habitats to attract and retain E. balteatus is an option farmers can consider if E. balteatus is to be encouraged into fields as part of a system of integrated pest management.},

We used these data and a null model to determine whether bee species' foraging choices varied more or less over time beyond the variation expected by chance. Thus we provide the first quantitative definition of rewiring and fidelity as these terms are used in the literature on interaction networks. All 52 bee species varied in plant partner choice across years, but for 27 species this variation was indistinguishable from random partner choice. Another 11 species showed rewiring, varying more across years than expected by chance, while 14 species showed fidelity, indicating that they both prefer certain plant species and are consistent in those preferences across years. Our study shows that rewiring and fidelity both exist in mutualist networks, but that once sampling effects have been accounted for, they are less common than has been reported in the ecological literature.},

The potential impact to ecologically significant wetlands in this dominantly agro-environment has largely been overlooked while the distribution of use, incidence and level of contamination remains unreported. We modelled the spatial distribution of neonicotinoid use across the three Prairie Provinces in combination with temporal assessments of water and sediment concentrations in wetlands to measure four active ingredients (clothianidin, thiamethoxam, imidacloprid and acetamiprid). From 2009 to 2012, neonicotinoid use was increasing; by 2012, applications covered an estimated ~11 million hectares (44% of Prairie cropland) with >216,000 kg of active ingredients. Thiamethoxam, followed by clothianidin, were the dominant seed treatments by mass and area. Areas of high neonicotinoid use were identified as high density canola or soybean production. Water sampled four times from 136 wetlands (spring, summer, fall 2012 and spring 2013) across four rural municipalities in Saskatchewan similarly revealed clothianidin and thiamethoxam in the majority of samples. In spring 2012 prior to seeding, 36% of wetlands contained at least one neonicotinoid. Detections increased to 62% in summer 2012, declined to 16% in fall, and increased to 91% the following spring 2013 after ice-off. Peak concentrations were recorded during summer 2012 for both thiamethoxam (range: <LOQ - 1490 ng/L, canola) and clothianidin (range: <LOQ - 3110 ng/L, canola). Sediment samples collected during the same period rarely (6%) contained neonicotinoid concentrations (which did not exceed 20 ng/L). Wetlands situated in barley, canola and oat fields consistently contained higher mean concentrations of neonicotinoids than in grasslands, but no individual crop singularly influenced overall detections or concentrations. Distribution maps indicate neonicotinoid use is increasing and becoming more widespread with concerns for environmental loading, while frequently detected neonicotinoid concentrations in Prairie wetlands suggest high persistence and transport into wetlands.},

Multiple linear regression indicated a predicted pod loss of 15.3 pods/plant over a distance of 1000 m from an apiary. This was equivalent to a 16% loss based on an average of 59 plants/m2 and average pod production of 5666 pods/m2 from this experiment. For a 2 t/ha crop this would be equivalent to about 320 kg/ha. The results are only indicative because of the variation in the crop studied and lack of replication, but may, in fact, be a conservative estimate.},

First, deploying honeybees increases the yield of seed. Second, that the benefits of honeybee pollination decline the further plants are from an apiary. Third, poorly pollinated plants should channel more resources into larger seeds, whereas plants benefiting from insect pollination should produce more but smaller seeds. The experiment confirmed all 3 hypotheses. Yields of seeds increased by more than 20% or 400kg/ha, whereas the yield declined in plots located more than 200m from the apiary. There are several explanations for the increased yield, including an enhanced production of fertile pods and, therefore, more seed, particularly small seed.},

  abstract  = {Abstract In a factorial field plot experiment, high and low levels of inorganic nitrogen and of insect pollinators visiting the crop were manipulated and their combined effects on oilseed rape yield were quantified. A third factor was also included, testing whether different cultivars responded differently to the tested factors. Insect pollination was required to reach high yield and seed quality (oil content). Final benefits of pollination service were, however, greatly modified by cultivar, where the seed yield of the open-pollinated cultivar largely depended on insect pollination whereas the two hybrid cultivars did not. A near significant interaction between nitrogen input and insect pollination was also found, i.e. benefits to crop yield from insect pollination seemed to increase with decreased nitrogen levels. The differential response of the three cultivars suggested opportunities to use cultivars that are less dependent on insect pollination in landscapes where this service has been deteriorated. Increased access of nitrogen seems to partly compensate yield losses from poor insect pollination. Integrating conservation, environmental and agronomic sciences is therefore crucial to sustain agriculture productions through optimized management of agronomic inputs and biodiversity-based ecosystem services.},

  abstract  = {Agricultural land management modifies ecosystem structure and functioning in natural landscapes. Pollinators are a key functional group that may suffer from such intensification. Here we evaluate how agricultural land management influences the diversity of pollen transported by pollinators and the pollination niche overlap among plants. We described pollen transport networks (which allow assessing the contribution of pollinators to the flow of pollen among plants) in agricultural and restored fragments in three sites representative of the pampas region of Argentina. We analyzed diversity of pollen transported by pollinators and the pollination niche overlap among plants in both types of fragments with general and generalized linear mixed models. The agricultural fragments were associated to increased diversity of transported pollen and pollination niche overlap among plants. Greater pollination niche overlap in agricultural fragments was associated with increased abundance of exotic plants. Our results indicate that agricultural intensification has significantly increased the diversity of pollen and the pollination niche overlap in natural communities by promoting exotic plants and generalized plant-pollinator interactions. Strategies to encourage improvements in the quality of pollination in agroecosystems could range from controlling the levels of exotic species to mechanisms that promote increased diversity of native plants.},

  abstract  = {Summary Weeds are major constraints on crop production, yet as part of the primary producers within farming systems, they may be important components of the agroecosystem. Using published literature, the role of weeds in arable systems for other above-ground trophic levels are examined. In the UK, there is evidence that weed flora have changed over the past century, with some species declining in abundance, whereas others have increased. There is also some evidence for a decline in the size of arable weed seedbanks. Some of these changes reflect improved agricultural efficiency, changes to more winter-sown crops in arable rotations and the use of more broad-spectrum herbicide combinations. Interrogation of a database of records of phytophagous insects associated with plant species in the UK reveals that many arable weed species support a high diversity of insect species. Reductions in abundances of host plants may affect associated insects and other taxa. A number of insect groups and farmland birds have shown marked population declines over the past 30 years. Correlational studies indicate that many of these declines are associated with changes in agricultural practices. Certainly reductions in food availability in winter and for nestling birds in spring are implicated in the declines of several bird species, notably the grey partridge, Perdix perdix. Thus weeds have a role within agroecosystems in supporting biodiversity more generally. An understanding of weed competitivity and the importance of weeds for insects and birds may allow the identification of the most important weed species. This may form the first step in balancing the needs for weed control with the requirements for biodiversity and more sustainable production methods.},

  abstract  = {Wild bees, which exhibit multiple functional traits enabling pollination of apples (Malus domestica Borkh), can potentially compensate for recent declines in domesticated honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) that are conventionally employed to ensure apple fruit and seed set. Whether compensation is possible will depend on functional diversity in the wild bee community and on the distribution of habitat and resources within the landscape surrounding an orchard that affect wild bee abundance. We studied pollination services and bee functional diversity in 20 apple orchards in southern Quebec, Canada. We evaluated pollinator efficacy by studying: apple visitation rates, approach (front or side-working), body size, foraging type (pollen or nectar foraging), sociality, temporal and climatic activity patterns, and pollen carrying habit. Pollination services were measured as apple fruit set and seed set. A distance-based measure of functional diversity, calibrated with bee traits and weighted by species relative abundance in the wild bee community, was used to model pollination services. We correlated the landscape composition and configuration of surrounding natural (forest) and semi-natural (meadow) habitats with bee diversity and pollination services. The incidence of fruit set and seed set in orchards increased with bee functional diversity. Complementarity between managed versus unmanaged bees in traits associated with foraging and resource use drove this relationship. Seed set was also negatively correlated with both the mean distance from surrounding meadows and the total area of surrounding orchards. Bee functional diversity was positively associated with surrounding meadow and forest area. These two land classes complement each other in their seasonal provision of foraging resources for bees. Our models can be used to prescribe management and conservation objectives for bee habitat management that promote pollination services. We identify useful wild bee pollinators and discuss their needs in terms of landscape composition and configuration.},

  Abstract                 = {Habitat fragmentation can have severe effects on plant pollinator interactions, for example changing the foraging
behaviour of pollinators. To date, the impact of plant population size on pollen collection by pollinators has not yet been
investigated. From 2008 to 2010, we monitored nine bumble bee species (Bombus campestris, Bombus hortorum s.l., Bombus
hypnorum, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus pratorum, Bombus soroensis, Bombus terrestris s.l., Bombus vestalis
s.l.) on Vaccinium uliginosum (Ericaceae) in up to nine populations in Belgium ranging in size from 80 m2 to over 3.1 ha.
Bumble bee abundance declined with decreasing plant population size, and especially the proportion of individuals of large
bumble bee species diminished in smaller populations. The most remarkable and novel observation was that bumble bees
seemed to switch foraging behaviour according to population size: while they collected both pollen and nectar in large
populations, they largely neglected pollen collection in small populations. This pattern was due to large bumble bee
species, which seem thus to be more likely to suffer from pollen shortages in smaller habitat fragments. Comparing pollen
loads of bumble bees we found that fidelity to V. uliginosum pollen did not depend on plant population size but rather on
the extent shrub cover and/or openness of the site. Bumble bees collected pollen only from three plant species
(V. uliginosum, Sorbus aucuparia and Cytisus scoparius). We also did not discover any pollination limitation of V. uliginosum in
small populations. We conclude that habitat fragmentation might not immediately threaten the pollination of V. uliginosum,
nevertheless, it provides important nectar and pollen resources for bumble bees and declining populations of this plant
could have negative effects for its pollinators. The finding that large bumble bee species abandon pollen collection when
plant populations become small is of interest when considering plant and bumble bee conservation.},

  abstract  = {Pollination biology is often associated with mutualistic interactions between plants and their animal pollen vectors, with energy rewards as the foundation for co-evolution. Energy is supplied as food (often nectar from flowers) or as heat (in sun-tracking or thermogenic plants). The requirements of pollinators for these resources depend on many factors, including the costs of living, locomotion, thermoregulation and behaviour, all of which are influenced by body size. These requirements are modified by the availability of energy offered by plants and environmental conditions. Endothermic insects, birds and bats are very effective, because they move faster and are more independent of environmental temperatures, than are ectothermic insects, but they are energetically costly for the plant. The body size of endothermic pollinators appears to be influenced by opposing requirements of the animals and plants. Large body size is advantageous for endotherms to retain heat. However, plants select for small body size of endotherms, as energy costs of larger size are not matched by increases in flight speed. If high energy costs of endothermy cannot be met, birds and mammals employ daily torpor, and large insects reduce the frequency of facultative endothermy. Energy uptake can be limited by the time required to absorb the energy or eliminate the excess water that comes with it. It can also be influenced by variations in climate that determine temperature and flowering season.},

  abstract  = {Agricultural activities such as tillage, drainage, intercropping, rotation, grazing and extensive usage of pesticides and fertilizers have significant implications for wild species of flora and fauna. Species capable of adapting to the agricultural landscape may be limited directly by the disturbance regimes of grazing, planting and harvesting, and indirectly by the abundance of plant and insect foods available. Some management techniques, such as drainage, create such fundamental habitat changes that there are significant shifts in species composition. This paper considers the relative merits of conventional tillage versus reduced, or no-till farming, and reviews the benefits of rest-rotation grazing, crop rotation and intercropping in terms of maintaining wild species populations. There are a number of undesirable environmental impacts associated with fertilizer and pesticide usage, and in this paper we attempt to provide an account of the ways in which these inputs impact on biodiversity at various levels including plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate groups. Factors which are considered include the mobility, trophic interactions, persistence, and spectrum of toxicity for various pesticides. The ecological virtues of organic and inorganic fertilizers are compared, and the problems arising from excessive use of fertilizer are discussed. The findings in this review indicate that chemical fertilizer loadings must be better budgeted to not exceed local needs, and that pesticide inputs should be reduced to a minimum. The types and regimes of disturbance due to mechanical operations associated with agricultural activity may also be modified to help reduce negative impacts on particular groups of species, such as birds. For those plant and insect species which need to be controlled for agronomic reasons, the population decreases brought about by disturbance regimes may be desirable as a form of pest management. The prevalence of agriculture over such a large portion of the Canadian landscape means that it is important that we find solutions to conflicts that arise between agriculture and wild species. It is important to realize that the impact of agricultural inputs varies greatly among regions and species, and actual effects have generally not been investigated for many species in any one locality; while the focus of this review is on Canada, much Canadian-specific research is lacking, thus, this review also draws from relevant research done elsewhere.},

  abstract  = {Anthropogenic climate change is widely expected to drive species extinct by hampering individual survival and reproduction, by reducing the amount and accessibility of suitable habitat, or by eliminating other organisms that are essential to the species in question. Less well appreciated is the likelihood that climate change will directly disrupt or eliminate mutually beneficial (mutualistic) ecological interactions between species even before extinctions occur. We explored the potential disruption of a ubiquitous mutualistic interaction of terrestrial habitats, that between plants and their animal pollinators, via climate change. We used a highly resolved empirical network of interactions between 1420 pollinator and 429 plant species to simulate consequences of the phenological shifts that can be expected with a doubling of atmospheric CO2. Depending on model assumptions, phenological shifts reduced the floral resources available to 17-50% of all pollinator species, causing as much as half of the ancestral activity period of the animals to fall at times when no food plants were available. Reduced overlap between plants and pollinators also decreased diet breadth of the pollinators. The predicted result of these disruptions is the extinction of pollinators, plants and their crucial interactions.},
  comment   = {Simulated artificial advances in flower plant phenology, and saw if plant/insect phenologies still matched up.

However:

- Was not grounded in any kind of physical model of how plants/insects respond to changing temperature
- Random changes in plant phenology (SD of 1,2,3 weeks) were not based on any previous study
- Assumed that both insect and flower emergence times would be a constant length. They seemed to think it was reasonable, but I'm not so sure.
- Assigned 10% of all plant spp a new "random" phenology that was based anywhere in the year. This seems really sketchy to me, and I don't really understand why they did it.

Therefore, this is more of a "network robustness" study, given the 1-3 week fake onsets that they plugged in.},

  abstract  = {Mutually beneficial interactions between flowering plants and animal pollinators represent a critical ‘ecosystem service’ under threat of anthropogenic extinction. We explored probable patterns of extinction in two large networks of plants and flower visitors by simulating the removal of pollinators and consequent loss of the plants that depend upon them for reproduction. For each network, we removed pollinators at random, systematically from least-linked (most specialized) to most-linked (most generalized), and systematically from most- to least-linked. Plant species diversity declined most rapidly with preferential removal of the most-linked pollinators, but declines were no worse than linear. This relative tolerance to extinction derives from redundancy in pollinators per plant and from nested topology of the networks. Tolerance in pollination networks contrasts with catastrophic declines reported from standard food webs. The discrepancy may be a result of the method used: previous studies removed species from multiple trophic levels based only on their linkage, whereas our preferential removal of pollinators reflects their greater risk of extinction relative to that of plants. In both pollination networks, the most-linked pollinators were bumble-bees and some solitary bees. These animals should receive special attention in efforts to conserve temperate pollination systems.},

Although primitive diptera have generally been regarded as relatively inefficient pollinators, fruit set for both species is high: 61-78% for L. cordata (1976-1978) and 94.3-98.5% for S. bigelovii (1978-1979). Since probability of pollination per visit is low, we attribute high fruit set to the large number of gnats present at our study sites and corresponding large number of visits to flowers. The relative frequency of geitonogamous vs. xenogamous pollen flow was estimated by emasculating flowers and subsequently comparing pollen reception or fruit set of emasculates with controls. Results for both species indicate that interplant movement of pollen is common Thus, fungus gnats can be effective pollen vectors, both in terms of overall fruit set and potential for cross-pollination.},

The influence of various parameters was studied. Regarding the effect of time of collection (fig 1, table I): the nectar secretions at 8 am were more abundant (mean of 60%) and less concentrated (= 1/3) than those at 2 pm; the relative concentrations of each sugar (glucose, fructose) were similar at 8 am and 2 pm and close to 50%. Compared to Darmor, cybrids produced less nectar (50% less for 27, 58, 85 and 90% less for 77 and 118). Regarding the effect of the day of collection (fig 2, table II): on average, the secretions were more abundant on May 3rd than on April 15th (23% more). Independently of the day, Darmor secreted more than the cybrids (65-95% more). The dry matter (19.3-22.4 mg/100 &mu;l) and the mean concentrations of each sugar (= 50%) were similar every day. Regarding the combined effect of the day and location (fig 3, tables III, IV): for every day and location, secretions were similar within cybrids and lower than that in Darmor (54-58% less). Amounts secreted (2-4 &mu;l on average) and total sugar amounts (= 15-40 mg/100 &mu;l) differed according to day and location, whereas the relative concentrations of each sugar remained constant. Thus, although large fluctuations might occur in the amounts of nectar, the glucidic composition of the nectars appeared to remain constant in each cybrid and favorable for entomophilous pollination.},

There was a good concordance between the male and female flowering, but female flowers secreted less nectar than male flowers. We obtained satisfactory pollination of female flowers but there was a pollination gradient. Flower setting was close to 70% on the first female strips placed either side of the male strips (1.4m distance) and close to 50% on the strips further away (4.2m).

Honey bees were the most important pollinators of female rapeseed (83% of the total population) and the supply of bee hives in the field increases pollinating efficiency but the dispersal of pollen by the wind and its efficiency are not negligable.},

  abstract  = {Promising performances of winter and spring oilseed rape have drawn attention to the interest of F1 hybrid varieties (Lefort-Buson & Datte 1985; Sernyk 1983). Amongst different sources of male cytoplasmic sterility currently under study (CMS, Rousselle 1981) is a CMS derived from radish (Ogura 1968; Bannerot et al 1983), improved by protoplast fusion (cybrids obtained by Pelletier et al 1983). However, because of difficulties encountered in selection of restorer lines (Pellan-Delourme 1986) the possibility of exploiting male sterility without fertility restoration in the hybrid F1 is being considered. One way of doing this is to use a `mixed' variety, in which F1 hybrid male-steriles obtained from cybrids mentioned above are exploited as `females', with male-fertile pollinisers, in a given proportion. Yield in such a mixture would be assured by the hybrid F1, the 'male' plants serving as pollen source. However, by-passing the problem of fertility restoration in cybrids in this way raises fresh problems. These make it necessary to examine the significance of factors affecting pollination, notably the role of bees, and of those involved in competition, in order to determine the type of male-fertile oilseed to be used, and the most appropriate proporation of fertile plants in the mixtures. As a first step work has begun using a same line of spring ra, in its male-fertile (`male') and male-sterile (`female') forms. Results of tests undertaken in 1985 are described here.},

Ces mêmes effets sont également apparus sur les plantes mâle-fertiles mais plus atténués et non significatifs, sauf en ce qui concerne les nouaisons et la production grainière de 1 000 fleurs. Le rendement en graines des plantes mâle-fertiles n’a finalement augmenté que de 6 %. L’effet dû au vent seul a été non négligeable sur les nouaisons des plantes mâle-stériles mais les rendements ont été au contraire négligeables.


The authors studied the effect of pollination on several phenological and yield characters of male-fertile winter rapeseed. Visitation caused changes in the male-sterile plants only, increasing numbers of flowers, forming fruits, siliques, seeds/pod, yield. It shortened flowering period, reduced primary branch size, flower production, and size of grains. The same effects appeared in male-fertile plants, but were not significant. Yield was increased by 6%. The effect of wind alone was significant on fruit-formation of the male-sterile plants, but the yield was not significantly different.},

This could be due to:
-smallish sample size (9 plots total, if data from both years are lumped together), but used 5 plants/plot. May not constitute independent samples (mixed models hadn't been invented yet).
-unrealistic bee treatment (lack of a queen changes foraging behaviour / desire to forage)

  abstract  = {Abstract There is ongoing concern regarding the observed decline in pollinator populations. Managing agricultural landscapes through agri-environment schemes (AES) supports biodiversity and could counteract pollinator population declines. We investigated whether alterations to current \{AES\} grassland mowing regimes would increase the abundance and species richness of wild bees and hoverflies. Furthermore, we investigated the response of different nesting and feeding guilds of wild bees and hoverflies, respectively, to these regimes. The three experimental mowing regimes were: (i) first cut not before 15 June, before the beginning of summer (Swiss \{AES\} management, control meadows); (ii) first cut delayed until 15 July (delayed meadows); (iii) as for control meadows but leaving 10–20% uncut as a refuge (refuge meadows). The rationale behind the delayed and refuge mowing regimes was extending the availability of floral resources for pollinators, while also providing refugia for species that may be directly impacted by mowing. Hoverflies and wild bees were collected in 2014 and 2015, respectively, using pan-trapping and sweep-netting, once before and once after the first cut. The two collecting methods showed contrasting results. While there was no difference in the abundance or richness of wild bees between the meadows when using pan traps, following the first cut, sweep-netting resulted in a higher abundance and richness of wild bees in delayed and refuge meadows compared to control meadows. Pan-trapping detected a higher abundance of hoverflies in delayed compared to refuge meadows, whereas sweep-netting detected a higher abundance in delayed and refuge compared to control meadows, after the first cut. Saprophagous hoverflies were more abundant in the control and delayed than refuge meadows following the first cut, when sampled with pan traps. Predatory hoverflies were more abundant and species rich in delayed and refuge compared to control meadows following the first cut, when sampled by sweep-netting. Our study demonstrates that simple alterations to a common \{AES\} grassland mowing regime can enhance populations of pollinators and natural enemies of crop pests. Furthermore, the contrasting response of the life-history guilds indicates that promoting heterogeneous management practices within the landscape is important for supporting diverse communities, and maintaining key ecosystem services such as pollination and biocontrol.},

For two-sided tests, this approach can be quite useful. We argue, however, that a chance-corrected approach should be preferred in most situations employing a one-sided test like, e.g., the triangle test. In randomized one-sided tests, the success probability is bounded below by p0, the success probability from pure guessing. A further development of the \{BB\} model accounting for this constraint is supported. Furthermore, we show that heterogeneity found from either a standard \{BB\} or a chance-corrected \{BB\} model proves that the products are different, i.e., testing for heterogeneity is one way of testing for product differences. The parameters of any \{BB\} approach have therefore to be considered in parallel. A simulation study indicates a better performance of the chance-corrected \{BB\} model as compared to the standard model.},

  abstract  = {Background and Aims In a future warmer sub{Arctic} climate, the soil temperatures experienced by dispersed seeds are likely to increase during summer but may decrease during winter due to expected changes in snow depth, duration and quality. Because little is known about the dormancy-breaking and germination requirements of sub{Arctic} species, how warming may influence the timing and level of germination in these species was examined.Methods Under controlled conditions, how colder winter and warmer summer soil temperatures influenced germination was tested in 23 sub{Arctic} species. The cold stratification and warm incubation temperatures were derived from real soil temperature measurements in sub{Arctic} tundra and the temperatures were gradually changed over time to simulate different months of the year.Key Results Moderate summer warming (+2.5 °C) substantially accelerated germination in all but four species but did not affect germination percentages. Optimum germination temperatures (20/10°C) further decreased germination time and increased germination percentages in three species. Colder winter soil temperatures delayed the germination in ten species and decreased the germination percentage in four species, whereas the opposite was found in Silene acaulis. In most species, the combined effect of a reduced snow cover and summer warming resulted in earlier germination and thus a longer first growing season, which improves the chance of seedling survival. In particular the recruitment of (dwarf) shrubs (Vaccinium myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea, Betula nana), trees (Alnus incana, Betula pubescens) and grasses (Calamagrostis lapponica, C. purpurea) is likely to benefit from a warmer sub{Arctic} climate.Conclusions Seedling establishment is expected to improve in a future warmer sub{Arctic} climate, mainly by considerably earlier germination. The magnitudes of the responses are species-specific, which should be taken into account when modelling population growth and migration of sub{Arctic} species.},

inferred using a phylogenetic approach. Here, using Australian Acacia as an example, we
show that the application of phylogenetic methods, particularly two new measures, relative
phylogenetic diversity and relative phylogenetic endemism, greatly enhances our knowledge
of biodiversity across both space and time. We found that areas of high species richness
and species endemism are not necessarily areas of high phylogenetic diversity or phylogenetic
endemism. We propose a new method called categorical analysis of neo- and paleoendemism
(CANAPE) that allows, for the first time, a clear, quantitative distinction between
centres of neo- and paleo-endemism, useful to the conservation decision-making process.},

  abstract  = {The use of path analysis has grown rapidly in recent years, yet few studies employ recent advances in the field of structural equation modelling (SEM). Here I illustrate the capabilities of SEM for path analyses, using data from a study of hummingbird pollination. The main drawback to conventional path analysis is that the overall agreement between the path diagram (or `model') and the data is not quantified; this also means that there is no clear way to directly compare competing models of the same system. One of the major advantages of SEM is that it can test the descriptive ability of different models, thus allowing them to be compared. When unmeasured latent variables are required (e.g. to circumvent problems with multi-collinearity to include estimates of measurement error, or to represent general `factors' such as size), SEM can directly incorporate them as well. Furthermore, SEM provides `modification indices' that indicate areas where the fit of a given model is especially poor, and therefore point to further observations or models that might adequately describe the data. Beyond these advantages, SEM also provides all the information provided by standard path analysis, including path coefficients, measures of explained variance, and total effects. These capabilities make structural equation modelling a powerful tool with which to apply path analysis to observational data sets in ecology and evolution.},

  abstract  = {Background Co-flowering plant species frequently share pollinators. Pollinator sharing is often detrimental to one or more of these species, leading to competition for pollination. Perhaps because it offers an intriguing juxtaposition of ecological opposites - mutualism and competition - within one relatively tractable system, competition for pollination has captured the interest of ecologists for over a century.
Scope Our intent is to contemplate exciting areas for further work on competition for pollination, rather than to exhaustively review past studies. After a brief historical summary, we present a conceptual framework that incorporates many aspects of competition for pollination, involving both the quantity and quality of pollination services, and both female and male sex functions of flowers. Using this framework, we contemplate a relatively subtle mechanism of competition involving pollen loss, and consider how competition might affect plant mating systems, overall reproductive success and multi-species interactions. We next consider how competition for pollination might be altered by several emerging consequences of a changing planet, including the spread of alien species, climate change and pollinator declines. Most of these topics represent new frontiers whose exploration has just begun.
Conclusions: Competition for pollination has served as a model for the integration of ecological and evolutionary perspectives in the study of species interactions. Its study has elucidated both obvious and more subtle mechanisms, and has documented a range of outcomes. However, the potential for this interaction to inform our understanding of both pure and applied aspects of pollination biology has only begun to be realized.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT Lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton (Ericaceae)) production is highly dependent on insect pollination to maximise yields. The current losses in honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) colonies pose a serious threat to the blueberry industry, raising interest in alternative pollinators. Abundance and diversity of native pollinators usually decreases with distance from natural habitats. In this study, we evaluated the effects of distance from wooded habitats such as windbreaks and forest borders on the presence of native pollinators in blueberry fields in Lac-St-Jean (Québec, Canada). Four treatments were compared: single-row, double-row, natural windbreaks, and forest borders. Pan-traps were placed at 5, 30, and 60 m from the windbreak or forest border. A total of 3878 native pollinators were collected and 81% were ground-nesting bees. The forest border was the only treatment with higher abundance and species richness on the periphery (5 m) of the field than at further distances, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of pollinators is favoured by habitats potentially offering more abundant and diverse nutritional resources. Our overall results reveal that native pollinators are distributed quite homogeneously in blueberry fields, suggesting that windbreaks are beneficial to native pollinator communities. Résumé La production du bleuet nain (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton (Ericaceae)) est fortement dépendante des insectes pollinisateurs pour maximiser les rendements. Le déclin des abeilles domestiques (Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) observé mondialement fragilise cette industrie qui a développé un intérêt pour une source alternative de pollinisation, les pollinisateurs indigènes. On observe généralement un impact négatif de l’éloignement des habitats naturels sur l’abondance et la richesse spécifique de ces communautés. Dans cette étude, nous avons évalué l’effet de l’éloignement des zones boisées telles que les haies brise-vent et les bordures de forêt sur la présence des pollinisateurs indigènes dans les cultures de bleuets nains au Lac-St-Jean (Québec, Canada). Quatre traitements ont été comparés: brise-vent à une rangée d’arbres, brise-vent à deux rangées d’arbres, brise-vent naturel et bordure de forêt. Des pièges-bols ont été placés à 5, 30 et 60 m des zones boisées. Un total de 3878 pollinisateurs indigènes a été collecté et 81% d’entre eux étaient des nicheurs de sol. L’abondance et la richesse spécifique étaient plus importantes en périphérie des champs (5 m) dans les traitements bordures de forêt comparativement aux autres traitements, supportant l’hypothèse que la présence des pollinisateurs est favorisée par un habitat offrant potentiellement des ressources nutritionnelles plus abondantes et plus diversifiées. L’ensemble de nos résultats indique que les pollinisateurs indigènes sont distribués de façon homogène en bleuetière, suggérant que les brise-vents ont un effet bénéfique sur les communautés de pollinisateurs indigènes.},

  abstract  = {Many recent field experiments have examined plant responses to global change factors such as climate warming, elevated atmospheric CO2, increased nitrogen addition or altered precipitation simulated at the plot level, yet the mechanisms underlying these responses can be difficult to isolate. One concern has been that the infrastructure used in these experiments can restrict the access of influential herbivores, detritivores or pollinators to the plots, and the absence of these animals is confounded with the treatment effects. However, in this paper we describe why free access by animals to experimental plots does not ensure realistic animal densities in response to global change treatments. On the contrary, much like moths swarm around streetlamps, animals that prefer the local conditions in treated plots may congregate at artificially high densities, or conversely, those that are repelled by the treatments may choose to avoid them. Therefore, animal densities or herbivore damage in the plots of global change experiments may grossly exaggerate or underestimate the contributions of animals to primary productivity or plant species composition under future environmental conditions. We describe how these potential animal congregation and avoidance artifacts may have been overlooked in the interpretation of results from many plot-level global change field experiments. We also provide suggestions for how to best interpret the results of these experiments and how to isolate the effects of animal density artifacts.},

In general, the mean root/shoot ratio increased from annuals, to herbaceous perennials, to woody perennials. Biennials and loblolly pine root/shoot ratios overlapped with herbaceous perennials. These data suggested that old field succession can be explained in part through an increase in root competition that must accompany the increase in root/shoot ratios of successive dominants. The dry weights of roots and shoots was found to be significantly correlated with height. It was suggested that this mathematical relationship may be used to modify present sampling techniques employed in standing crop, root production and mineral cycle studies.},

Flowering crops offer pulsed and abundant floral resources (i.e., mass flowering crops) that might promote pollinator spill-over between cultivated and adjacent natural areas. We explored pollinator patterns in the mass flowering legume crop Hedysarum coronarium and its influence on the bee pollinator communities of adjacent shrublands in a heterogeneous and patchy agricultural landscape. We studied the temporal (i.e., during vs. after mass flowering in adjacent shrublands) and spatial (i.e., inside crops, adjacent and distant shrublands during mass flowering) functional pollinator spill-over. The honeybee was highly attracted to Hedysarum crops, yet its abundance and that of other bee species visiting native plants in adjacent shrublands did not differ during and after Hedysarum mass flowering. However, at the landscape scale, the honeybee and the other bee species were less abundant in shrublands adjacent to Hedysarum crops compared to distant ones; their visitation rates showing a similar trend. These results show that some mass flowering crops can influence pollinator patterns in the surrounding landscape by competing for generalist pollinators with native plants. The characteristics of the crop species and the landscape can modulate and determine the role of mass flowering crops as competitors or supporters of wild pollinators for adjacent natural areas.},

They concluded that the birds were not foraging optimally. We show here that their birds probably maximized a different utility function, the net energy per unit volume consumed (NEVC), which appears to be an optimal choice on a time scale longer than that of a foraging bout. Our own experiments with Archilochus eolubris support the conclusion that hummingbirds make foraging decisions that maximize NEVC. A simulation model shows that, in nature, NEVC maximization would require fewer foraging trips and visits to fewer flowers per day to balance daily energy budgets. For territorial birds this can lead to smaller territory sizes and reduced costs of territorial defense. Plants that evolutionarily increase corolla length to enhance pollinator specificity need only increase nectar concentration slightly to maintain the same net energy per unit volume consumed (NEVC) by a given hummingbird pollinator.},

  abstract  = {We examine the trade-off between gathering food and avoiding predation in the context of patch use by a group of animals. Often a forager will have to choose between feeding sites that differ in both energetic gain rate and predation risk. The ideal site will have a high gain rate and low risk of predation. However, intake rate will often decrease when the patch is shared with other foragers and it may be optimal for some individuals to feed elsewhere. Within the framework of ideal free theory, we investigate the distribution of foragers that will equalise individual fitness gains. We focus on a two-patch environment with continuous inputs of food. With reference to existing experimental studies, we examine the effects of risk dilution, food input rates and an animal's expectations of the future. We identify the effect of total animal numbers when one patch is subject to predation risk and the other is safe. Conditions under which the difference in intake rate in the two patches is constant are identified, as are conditions in which the ratio of animals in the two patches is constant. If current conditions do not alter future expectations an increase in input rates to the patches promotes increased use of the risky patch. Yet, if conditions are assumed to persist indefinitely the opposite effect is seen. When both patches are subject to predation risk, dilution of risk favours more extreme distributions, and may lead to more than one stable distribution. The results of these models are used to critically analyse previous work on the energetic equivalence of risk. This paper is intended to help guide the development of new experimental studies into the energy-risk trade-off.},

However, there was a large amount of uncultivated land around, which may provide habitat for wild bees. Larger acreages and fewer nesting opportunities near fields might have different patterns.

"Yield" metric is # of seeds per silique, but on a commercial scale kg/m2 would be more meaningful.

"Effective weed management of canola can significantly improve yield, and growers are unlikely to adopt poorer weed control methods in order to improve bee abundance and seed set. If lower weed cover is the causative factor for the lower bee abundance in GM fields compared to conventionally grown canola, then growers of GM canola would benefit by promoting bee populations through other methods."},

  abstract  = {In intensive agricultural landscapes, restoration within farms could enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services such as pollination by native pollinators. Although governments and conservation groups are promoting small-scale restoration on working farms, there are few studies that assess whether these practices enhance pollinator communities in restored areas. Further, there is no information on whether floral enhancements will deplete pollinators in adjacent fields by concentrating ambient populations or whether they result in a net increase in abundance in adjacent farm fields. We investigated whether field edges restored with native perennial plants in California's Central Valley agricultural region increased floral abundance and potential bee nesting sites, and native bee and syrphid fly abundance and diversity, in comparison to relatively unmanaged edges. Native bees and syrphid flies collected from flowers were more abundant, species-rich, and diverse at hedgerow sites than in weedy, unmanaged edges. Abundance of bees collected passively in pan traps was negatively correlated with floral abundance, was significantly different from communities captured by net sampling from flowers, and did not distinguish between site types; we therefore focused on the results of net samples and visual observations. Uncommon species of native bees were sevenfold more abundant on hedgerow flowers than on flowers at weedy, unmanaged edges. Of the species on flowers at hedgerows, 40% were exclusive to hedgerow sites, but there were no species exclusively found on flowers at control sites. Hedgerows were especially important for supporting less-common species of native bees in our intensive agricultural landscape. Hedgerows did not concentrate ambient native bee, honey bee, or syphid fly populations, and they acted as net exporters of native bees into adjacent fields. Within-farm habitat restoration such as hedgerow creation may be essential for enhancing native pollinator abundance and diversity, and for pollination services to adjacent crops.},

  abstract  = {The ecological impacts of agriculture are of concern, especially with genetically modified and other intensive, modern cropping systems, yet little is known about effects on wild bee populations and subsequent implications for pollination. Pollination deficit (the difference between potential and actual pollination) and bee abundance were measured in organic, conventional, and herbicide-resistant, genetically modified (GM) canola fields (Brassica napus and B. rapa) in northern Alberta, Canada, in the summer of 2002. Bee abundance data were collected using pan traps and standardized sweep netting, and pollination deficit was assessed by comparing the number of seeds per fruit from openpollinated and supplementally pollinated flowers. There was no pollination deficit in organic fields, a moderate pollination deficit in conventional fields, and the greatest pollination deficit in GM fields. Bee abundance was greatest in organic fields, followed by conventional fields, and lowest in GM fields. Overall, there was a strong, positive relationship between bee abundance at sampling locations and reduced pollination deficits. Seed set in B. napas increased with greater bee abundance. Because B. rapa is an obligate outcrossing species, the lack of pollination deficit in the organic (B. rapa) fields likely was due to the high bee abundance rather than a lower dependence of B. rapa on pollinators than B. napus canola. Our study illustrates the importance of wild bees to agricultural production and suggests that some agroecosystems may better sustain wild bee abundance, resulting in greater seed production. Further research on why some cropping systems, such as genetically modified, herbicide-resistant canola, have low wild bee abundance would be useful for management of agroecosystems to promote sustainability of food production.},

Natural and semi-natural reserve areas in agroecosystems are thought to be important for preservation of essential ecosystem services such as pollination, but data about land use patterns and pollinator abundance are lacking. We assessed wild bee populations in canola fields in an agriculturally intense area where virtually all land was either tilled agricultural fields or semi-natural grazed pasturelands, with the expectation that mosaics of land use types may better support ecosystem services than homogenous crop areas. Fields were chosen in two categories, five with little or no pastureland (<6%) and five with at least 15% pastureland within an 800m distance of field edges. Fields in the high pasture category had more bumble bees and other wild bees than low pasture fields and 94% of the variation in bumble bee abundance in fields was explained by variation in the amount of pastureland nearby. Lower bee abundance in fields with little pastureland around them could result in reduced pollination and seed set unless supplemented with managed pollinators such as honeybees. In areas with intense agriculture we show that mosaics of land use types can be better for wild bee populations and potentially for crop production than landscapes that are homogenous tilled crop areas. Designing agricultural areas that integrate land use and ecosystem function is a practical approach for promoting sustainable agriculture practices.},

2. We assess the changes in species and functional trait composition (i.e. dominant traits and function diversity) of diverse bee communities in contrasting fire-driven systems in two climatic regions: Mediterranean (scrub habitats in Israel) and temperate (chestnut forests in southern Switzerland). 
3. In both climatic regions, there were shifts in species diversity and composition related to post-fire age. In the temperate region, functional composition responded markedly to fire; however, in the Mediterranean, the taxonomic response to fire was not matched by functional replacement. 
4. These results suggest that greater functional stability to fire in the Mediterranean is achieved by replacement of functionally similar species (i.e. functional redundancy) which dominate under different environmental conditions in the heterogeneous landscapes of the region. In contrast, the greater functional response in the temperate region was attributed to a more rapid post-fire vegetation recovery and shorter time-window when favourable habitat was available relative to the Mediterranean. 
5. Bee traits can be used to predict the functional responses of bee communities to environmental changes in habitats of conservation importance in different regions with distinct disturbance regimes. However, predictions cannot be generalized from one climatic region to another where distinct habitat configurations occur.},

  abstract  = {The pattern of recent surface warming observed in the Arctic exhibits both polar amplification and a strong relation with trends in the Arctic Oscillation mode of atmospheric circulation. Paleoclimate analyses indicate that Arctic surface temperatures were higher during the 20th century than during the preceding few centuries and that polar amplification is a common feature of the past. Paleoclimate evidence for Holocene variations in the Arctic Oscillation is mixed. Current understanding of physical mechanisms controlling atmospheric dynamics suggests that anthropogenic influences could have forced the recent trend in the Arctic Oscillation, but simulations with global climate models do not agree. In most simulations, the trend in the Arctic Oscillation is much weaker than observed. In addition, the simulated warming tends to be largest in autumn over the Arctic Ocean, whereas observed warming appears to be largest in winter and spring over the continents.},

  abstract  = {Habitat selection, and its associated density and frequency-dependent evolution, has a profound influence on such vital phenomena as population regulation, species interactions, the assembly of ecological communities, and the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Different strategies of habitat selection, and their importance in ecology and evolution, can often be revealed simply by plots of density in adjacent habitats. For individual species, the strategies are closely intertwined with mechanisms of population regulation, and with the persistence of populations through time. For interacting species, strategies of habitat selection are not only responsible for species coexistence, but provide one of the most convenient mechanisms for measuring competition, and the various community structures caused by competitive interactions. Other kinds of interactions, such as those between predators and prey, demonstrate that an understanding of the coevolution of habitat-selection strategies among strongly interacting species is essential to properly interpret their spatial and temporal dynamics. At the evolutionary scale, the frequency dependence associated with habitat selection may often allow populations to diverge and diversify into separate species. Habitat selection thereby demonstrates how we can map microevolutionary strategies in behavior onto their population and community consequences, and from there, onto macroevolutionary patterns of speciation and adaptive radiation. We can anticipate that future studies of habitat selection will not only help us complete those maps, but that they will also continue to enrich the panoply of ideas that shape evolutionary ecology.},

Nevertheless our understanding of the mechanism that generates spatial patterns of pollen dispersal in animal-pollinated plants, namely the combine processes of pollinator movement and pollen deposition, is at present qualitative. I show how easily measured characteristics of pollinator movement and pollen deposition can be used to build models that generate quantitative predictions about pollen dispersal distance. A field experiment in which I followed honey bees (Apis mellifera) foraging on one-dimensional arrays of mustard plants (Brassica campestris) indicated that individual honeybees have a biased direction of movement and alter their movement patterns in response to plant spacing. I used the model to explore the potential consequences of biased movement and plant spacing for pollen dispersal. Biased movement results in an increase in the expected pollen dispersal distance. In addition, the predicted dispersal distance increased with increasing interplant distance. These results demonstrate that models of pollen spatial dynamics based on individual pollinator behavior can be used to explore the consequences of plant spatial arrangement for gene flow in plant populations.},

  abstract  = {Refuging predators are under selective pressure to minimize not only the time needed to find a prey patch but also the distance from this patch back to the refuge. A simple geometrical model of a search path reveals that minimizing search time and minimizing commuting distance require conflicting search-path characteristics. Search time is minimized by paths with relatively low rates of turning, as these reduce the chances of searching over areas previously searched. In contrast, commuting distance is minimized by paths with relatively high turning rates, as these improve the chances of encountering a prey patch nearer the refuge. The relative importance of searching versus commuting depends on the number of return visits a predator can expect to make to a known patch. The model predicts that even for predators which return to a known patch many times, total foraging time is minimized by a search path expected to find not the nearest patch but one a few times more distant. Therefore, many of the prey patches within the commuting radius of an optimally foraging predator will remain unknown to, and so unused by, that predator. This may help to explain why the foraging ranges of some animals can be so broadly overlapping.},

The difference in bumblebee impact on the two syrphids resulted from Toxomerus rapidly returning after visits by bumblebees, while Melanostoma did not. Toxomerus used flowers most frequently when Melanostoma were not in them. Bumblebee foraging patterns appeared unaffected by either syrphid fly. Melanostoma may have a considerably greater impact than bumblebees on Toxomerus; a 14% reduction in foraging by Toxomerus was recorded in one test. This was because Melanostoma occupied flowers for several minutes at a time, while bumblebee visits lasted only several seconds. By affecting Melanostoma's activity, bumblebees inadvertently favored Toxomerus, because the latter returned quickly to flowers after bee visits; Melanostoma did not.},

From snow-melting time (early May) to the end of May, pollinating insects were abundant and competed actively for relatively scarce pollen and nectar resources. Then, in early June some "cornucopian species" (Salix s and Taraxacum officinale L.) began flowering abundantly offering virtually unlimited supplies of nectar and pollen. Pollinating insects abandoned the spring flowers and were attracted to these cornucopian species. It is postulated that in the presence of cornucopian species natural selection would favor the evolution of earlier- or later-flowering populations of all those species that compete with the cornucopians for pollinators. It was found that in the spring, insects competed for flowers but that after the cornucopian species had completed their flowering (throughout the summer), flowers competed for pollinating insects.},

It has been suggested that patchiness in the distribution of nectar can give an advantage to “near-far” type of foraging strategies; that is, to foragers which search “near” (in the neighborhood of the last visited flower) as long as the nectar yield is high enough and go “far” otherwise. To explore the evolutionary stability of near-far search, various foraging strategies were compared, according to two, slightly different optimality criteria: the number of flowers emptied during a fixed length bout and the number of flowers visited until total extraction of the entire inflorescence. With long bouts (in the case of a single forager) or a substantial probability of revisits to the same inflorescence (in the case of multiple foragers), a near-far foraging strategy is an ESS. Furthermore, prior patchiness in the nectar distribution is not a necessary condition for the evolutionary stability of near-far search. It turns out that during near-far foraging some patchiness is created by the foraging process itself, which the near-far forager can exploit later on.},

Although inadequate pollination seems likely in the community, supplemental hand-pollination significantly improved fecundity in just 3 of the 12 species I examined. Pollination-limited reproductive success was evident only in a distinctive subset of the community, species pollinated primarily by queen bumble bees. The majority of wildflower species are pollinated by flies and solitary bees. Measurements of visitation rates and pollinator effectiveness on these plants confirmed that they are usually adequately pollinated in spite of a short blooming season, considerable overlap in flowering times, extensive pollinator sharing by concurrently blooming species, and inclement weather that frequently interrupts insect activity. Many of the flies and solitary bees are inconstant foragers, yet competition for pollination among wildflower species through differential pollinator attraction or interspecific pollinator movements usually does not significantly decrease the seed-set of plants with shared visitors. Competition may act with other causes of insufficient pollination, however, as a selective force to maintain a characteristic set of floral biology traits within the community, including autogamy and self-compatibility, extended receptivity, and pollination by a variety of visitor types. That these floral traits contribute significantly to the successful pollination of vernal herbs was demonstrated by observations of visitor behavior, plant caging experiments that excluded visitors or restricted their access to selected flowers, and measurements of floral lifetimes and seed-set for individual plants. These traits are effective regardless of the source of pollination-limited fecundity, and it is the prevalence of such traits, rather than floral specialization or character displacement, that distinguishes the forest spring wildflower community from other communities with potentially inadequate pollinator service.},

  abstract  = {Pollinator populations respond to environmental changes operating on different spatial scales, but the contribution of scale-dependent habitat management to crop pollination and yield-gap reduction is little understood. Here, we analyze how bee abundance and their effects on cucumber production in tropical homegardens is driven by factors measured on three spatial scales; the (1) homegarden scale (flower cover of the focal homegarden); the (2) adjacent-habitat scale (amount of homegarden habitat within a 200 m radius around the focal homegarden); and the (3) landscape scale (distance of the focal homegarden to the nearest forest from 0 to 2200 m). We also evaluate bee responses according to functional traits such as body size. We found that bees were affected by factors on multiple spatial scales. On the homegarden scale, the percentage flower cover best predicted pollinator attraction, if, on the adjacent-habitat scale the percentage of surrounding homegardens was at least 20%. On the landscape scale, bee abundance, mainly of small species, increased when homegardens were closer to the forest. Increasing abundance of flower-visiting bees increased cucumber yield, with solitary bees being the most abundant flower visitors. We predicted that a 50% loss in bee abundance would translate into a 47% yield and associated income decline. Homegardens with a flower cover of 50%, being surrounded by a homegarden area of 50% and being established &lt;100 m from the forest can translate in a nine-fold higher yield and income compared to homegardens with low flower cover (~15%), and isolated from other homegardens (~20%) and the forest (~1500 m). Our work suggests that farmers need to be aware of management practices not only at the local and landscape scale but also on the adjacent-habitat scale. Only then farmers can increase wild bee populations to reduce crop yield gaps through pollination services.},

  abstract  = {Stress has complex effects on learning and memory, depending on both the type of stress and when the animal experiences it. Honeybees and bumblebees are agriculturally important pollinators for whom the effects of stress are extremely relevant. These pollinators are often transported long distances during which colonies experience severe physical disturbance, causing stress to individuals prior to their release for pollination. Under natural foraging conditions, bees are excellent at learning about the flowers they forage from, including associations between floral stimuli and rewards. However, it is not clear how stress might affect bees’ abilities to learn and remember floral features. Here we address the effects of acute stress on learning and memory in the bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. Using the Proboscis Extension Response (PER) protocol, we look at stress effects on learning and memory in three experiments. After being trained to a conditioned stimulus, we addressed: (1) the effect of 24 h and (2) 30 min of stress on the recall of this learned association and (3) the effect of stress on subsequently learning an association. We found that 24 h of stress after learning appeared to improve memory recall, and there was a trend in the same direction for 30 min of stress. However, bees that were stressed prior to learning an association did not differ from unstressed bees in their ability to learn or remember an association. Our finding that stress has effects on memory in the bumblebee could have implications for their use in behavioral experiments and for promoting the success of both managed and wild populations.},

The main constituents of nectar are sugars, which vary in both composition and concentration between plant species. We assessed the influence of sugar concentration, sugar solution viscosity and sugar solution composition on the imbibition and energy intake rate of bumblebees, Bombus impatiens Cresson (Hymenoptera: Apidae). To do this, we measured their rate of solution intake for 49 different sugar solution treatments, which varied in both sugar composition and concentration. In general, the imbibition rates of bumblebees were found to increase with increasing sugar concentration, probably due to their preference for high sugar concentrations, up to a concentration of 27% (w/w), at which point solutions reached a threshold viscosity of approximately 1.5–1.6 mPa.s. Above this threshold, the increasing viscosity of the solutions physically inhibited the imbibition rates of bees, and imbibition rate began to decrease as the concentration increased. Nevertheless, bumblebee energy intake rate increased with increasing concentration up to about 42–56%. Although we found that sugar solution composition had an impact on both imbibition and energy intake rate, its effect was not as straightforward as that of sugar concentration and viscosity.},

  abstract  = {Pollination services are economically important component of agricultural biodiversity which enhance the yield and quality of many crops. An understanding of the suitability of extant habitats for pollinating species is crucial for planning management actions to protect and manage these service providers. In a highly modified agricultural ecosystem, we tested the effect of different pollination treatments (open, autonomous self- and wind-pollination) on pod set, seed set, and seed weight in field beans (Vicia faba). We also investigated the effect of semi-natural habitats and flower abundance on pollinators of field beans. Pollinator sampling was undertaken in ten field bean fields along a gradient of habitat complexity; CORINE land cover classification was used to analyse the land use patterns between 500-3000m around the sites. Total yield from open-pollination increased by 185% compared to autonomous self-pollination. There was positive interactive effect of local flower abundance and cover of semi-natural habitats on overall abundance of pollinators at 1500 and 2000m, and abundance of bumblebees (Bombus s) at 1000-2000m. In contrast, species richness of pollinators was only correlated with flower abundance and not with semi-natural habitats. We did not find a link between pod set from open-pollination and pollinator abundance, possibly due to variations in the growing conditions and pollinator communities between sites. We conclude that insect pollination is essential for optimal bean yields and therefore the maintenance of semi-natural habitats in agriculture-dominated landscapes should ensure stable and more efficient pollination services in field beans.},

  abstract  = {Background and Aims: Fabrics used in pollination bags may exclude pollen carried by biotic vectors, but have varying degrees of permeability to wind-borne pollen. The permeability of bags to wind-borne pollen may have important consequences in studies of pollination and reproductive biology. The permeability of four fabrics commonly used in the construction of pollination bags was examined.
Methods: Deposition of wind-borne pollen on horizontally and vertically oriented microscope slides was assessed on slides enclosed in pollination bags, as well as on control slides.
Key Results: It was found that the permeability of fabrics to wind-borne pollen, as measured by deposition on both horizontally and vertically oriented slides, decreased with pore size. However, deposition on horizontal slides was always greater than on vertical slides for a given fabric; this could manifest itself as differential success of pollination of flowers in bags—dependent on flower orientation.
Conclusions: Obviously, bags with mesh size smaller than most pollen grains are impermeable to pollen. However, material for such bags is very expensive. In addition, it was also observed that bags with even moderately small pore size, such as pores (approx. 200 µm) in twisted fibre cotton muslin, offered highly significant barriers to passage of wind-borne pollen. Such bags are sufficiently effective in most large-sample-size reproductive biology studies.},

affected by climate change. Plausible estimates of these climate
change impacts require combined use of climate, crop, and
economic models. Results from previous studies vary substantially
due to differences in models, scenarios, and data. This paper is
part of a collective effort to systematically integrate these three
types of models. We focus on the economic component of the
assessment, investigating how nine global economic models of
agriculture represent endogenous responses to seven standardized
climate change scenarios produced by two climate and five crop
models. These responses include adjustments in yields, area, consumption,
and international trade. We apply biophysical shocks
derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s representative
concentration pathway with end-of-century radiative
forcing of 8.5 W/m2. The mean biophysical yield effect with no incremental
CO2 fertilization is a 17% reduction globally by 2050 relative
to a scenario with unchanging climate. Endogenous economic
responses reduce yield loss to 11%, increase area of major crops by
11%, and reduce consumption by 3%. Agricultural production, cropland
area, trade, and prices showthe greatest degree of variability in
response to climate change, and consumption the lowest. The sources
of these differences include model structure and specification; in
particular, model assumptions about ease of land use conversion,
intensification, and trade. This study identifies where models disagree
on the relative responses to climate shocks and highlights
research activities needed to improve the representation of agricultural
adaptation responses to climate change.},

  abstract  = {Background:
During the last few years, DNA sequence analysis has become one of the primary means of taxonomic identification of species, particularly so for species that are minute or otherwise lack distinct, readily obtainable morphological characters. Although the number of sequences available for comparison in public databases such as GenBank increases exponentially, only a minuscule fraction of all organisms have been sequenced, leaving taxon sampling a momentous problem for sequence-based taxonomic identification. When querying GenBank with a set of unidentified sequences, a considerable proportion typically lack fully identified matches, forming an ever-mounting pile of sequences that the researcher will have to monitor manually in the hope that new, clarifying sequences have been submitted by other researchers. To alleviate these concerns, a project to automatically monitor select unidentified sequences in GenBank for taxonomic progress through repeated local BLAST searches was initiated. Mycorrhizal fungi - a field where species identification often is prohibitively complex - and the much used ITS locus were chosen as test bed.
Results:
A Perl script package called emerencia is presented. On a regular basis, it downloads select sequences from GenBank, separates the identified sequences from those insufficiently identified, and performs BLAST searches between these two datasets, storing all results in an SQL database. On the accompanying web-service http://emerencia.math.chalmers.se webcite, users can monitor the taxonomic progress of insufficiently identified sequences over time, either through active searches or by signing up for e-mail notification upon disclosure of better matches. Other search categories, such as listing all insufficiently identified sequences (and their present best fully identified matches) publication-wise, are also available.
Discussion:
The ever-increasing use of DNA sequences for identification purposes largely falls back on the assumption that public sequence databases contain a thorough sampling of taxonomically well-annotated sequences. Taxonomy, held by some to be an old-fashioned trade, has accordingly never been more important. emerencia does not automate the taxonomic process, but it does allow researchers to focus their efforts elsewhere than countless manual BLAST runs and arduous sieving of BLAST hit lists. The emerencia system is available on an open source basis for local installation with any organism and gene group as targets.},

It has therefore been an important field of study in human psychology and neuroscience. Primates, however, are not the only animals that might benefit from attention-like processes. Other animals, including insects, also have to use their senses and select one among many stimuli to forage, avoid predators and find mates. They have evolved different mechanisms to reduce the information processed by their brains to focus on only relevant stimuli. What are the mechanisms used by insects to selectively attend to visual and auditory stimuli? Do these attention-like mechanisms achieve the same functions as they do in primates? To investigate these questions, I use an established framework for investigating attention in non-human animals that proposes four fundamental components of attention: salience filters, competitive selection, top-down sensitivity control and working memory. I discuss evidence for each of these component processes in insects and compare the characteristics of these processes in insects to what we know from primates. Finally, I highlight important outstanding questions about insect attention that need to be addressed for us to understand the differences and similarities between vertebrate and insect attention.},

  abstract  = {The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) is the dominant paradigm in predicting
 patch use and numerous tests support its qualitative predictions. Quantitative
 tests under complex foraging situations could be expected to be more variable
 in their support because the MVT assumes behavior maximizes only net
 energy-intake rate. However across a survey of 26 studies, foragers rather
 consistently “erred” in staying too long in patches. Such a
 consistent direction to the errors suggests that the simplifying assumptions
 of the MVT introduce a systematic bias rather than just imprecision.
 Therefore, I simulated patch use as a state-dependent response to
 physiological state, travel cost, predation risk, prey densities, and fitness
 currencies other than net-rate maximization (e.g., maximizing survival,
 reproductive investment, or mating opportunities). State-dependent behavior
 consistently results in longer patch residence times than predicted by the MVT
 or another foraging model, the minimize mu/g rule, and these rules fail to
 closely approximate the best behavioral strategy over a wide range of
 conditions. Because patch residence times increase with state-dependent
 behavior, this also predicts mass regulation below maximum energy capacities
 without direct mass-specific costs. Finally, qualitative behavioral
 predictions from the MVT about giving-up densities in patches and the effects
 of travel costs are often inconsistent with state-dependent behavior. Thus in
 order to accurately predict patch exploitation patterns, the model highlights
 the need to: (1) consider predator behavior (sit-and-wait versus actively
 foraging); (2) identify activities that can occur simultaneously to foraging
 (i.e., mate search or parental care); and (3) specify the range of nutritional
 states likely in foraging animals. Future predictive models of patch use
 should explicitly consider these parameters.},

Using an Australian native bee as a model, we demonstrate for the first time a significant shift in behaviour when the ambient temperature reaches 34°C, at which point bees prefer ambient temperature nectar over warmer nectar. We then use thermal imaging techniques to show warmer nectar maintains the flight temperature of bees during the period of rest on flowers at lower ambient temperatures but the behavioural switch is associated with the body temperature rising above that maintained during flight. These findings suggest that flower-pollinator interactions are dependent upon ambient temperature and may therefore alter in different thermal environments.},

  abstract  = {Abstract: Pollination regulates a syndrome of developmental responses that contributes to successful sexual reproduction in higher plants. Pollination-regulated developmental events collectively prepare the flower for fertilization and embryogenesis while bringing about the loss of floral organs that have completed their function in pollen dispersal and reception. Components of this process include changes in flower pigmentation, senescence and abscission of floral organs, growth and development of the ovary, and, in certain cases, pollination also triggers ovule and female gametophyte development in anticipation of fertilization. Pollination-regulated development is initiated by the primary pollination event at the stigma surface, but because developmental processes occur in distal floral organs, the activity of interorgan signals that amplify and transmit the primary pollination signal to floral organs is implicated. Interorgan signaling and signal amplification involves the regulation of ethylene biosynthetic gene expression and interorgan transport of hormones and their precursors. The coordination of pollination- regulated flower development including gametophyte, embryo, and ovary development; pollination signaling; the molecular regulation of ethylene biosynthesis; and interorgan communication are presented.},

The International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) was initiated in 1990 to evaluate the effects of expected rapid changes in temperature on tundra plant phenology, growth and community changes using experimental warming. Here, we used the ITEX control data to test the phenological responses to background temperature variation across sites spanning latitudinal and moisture gradients. The dataset overall did not show an advance in phenology; instead, temperature variability during the years sampled and an absence of warming at some sites resulted in mixed responses. Phenological transitions of high Arctic plants clearly occurred at lower heat sum thresholds than those of low Arctic and {Alpine} plants. However, sensitivity to temperature change was similar among plants from the different climate zones. Plants of different communities and growth forms differed for some phenological responses. Heat sums associated with flowering and greening appear to have increased over time. These results point to a complex suite of changes in plant communities and ecosystem function in high latitudes and elevations as the climate warms.},

  abstract  = {Animals collecting resources that are fixed in space but replenish over time, such as floral nectar and pollen, often establish small foraging areas to which they return faithfully. Some repeatedly visit a set of patches in a significantly predictable sequence (so-called “trapline foraging”), which may allow them to focus on more profitable patches in their foraging areas. The functional significance of trapline foraging itself, however, has not been empirically demonstrated, especially in competitive situations. We conducted laboratory experiments with artificial flowers to test whether and how accumulated foraging experience in bumble bees affects their movement patterns and foraging performance in the presence of competition. Experienced bees with prior access to flowers achieved higher rates of nectar intake than did later arrivals because they traveled faster between flowers and returned to flowers at more regular intervals. These behavioral skills improved foraging performance in competitive situations in 2 ways: nectar that accumulated in flowers could be harvested before its replenishment rate slowed down, and nectar could be taken before the arrival of a competitor. In each foraging trip, however, bees traveled more slowly as they followed more repeatable routes. Despite this trade-off between speed and accuracy in traplining, bees constantly upgraded both skills as they gained experience from trip to trip. This upgrading still occurred in the absence of a competitor. Foraging area fidelity thus allowed bumble bees to establish long-term spatial memory required for fast movements and accurate traplining and, in turn, increased their foraging performance in competition with less experienced individuals.},

  abstract  = {Background Trapline foraging (repeated sequential visits to a series of feeding locations) has been often observed in pollinators collecting nectar or pollen from flowers. Although field studies on bumble-bees and hummingbirds have clarified fundamental aspects of this behaviour, trapline foraging still poses several difficult questions from the perspectives of both animals and plants. These questions include whether and how traplining improves foraging performance, how animals develop traplines with accumulating foraging experience, and how traplining affects pollen flow or plant reproduction.Scope First, we review our previous work performed by using computer simulations and indoor flight-cage experiments with bumble-bees foraging from arrays of automated feeders. Our findings include the following: (1) traplining benefits foragers that are competing for resources that replenish in a decelerating way, (2) traplining is a learned behaviour that develops over a period of hours and (3) the establishment of traplines could be hampered by spatial configuration of plants such as zigzags. Second, using a simulation model linking pollinator movement and pollen transfer, we consider how service by pollinators with different foraging patterns (searchers or trapliners) would affect pollen flow. Traplining increases mating distance and mate diversity, and reduces ‘iterogamy’ (self-pollination caused by return visits) at the population level. Furthermore, increased visitation rates can have opposite effects on the reproductive success of a plant, depending on whether the visitors are traplining or searching. Finally, we discuss possible consequences of traplining for plants in the light of new experimental work and modelling.Conclusions We suggest that trapline foraging by pollinators increases variation among plant populations in genetic diversity, inbreeding depression and contributions of floral traits to plant fitness, which should in turn affect the rates and directions of floral evolution. More theoretical and empirical studies are needed to clarify possible outcomes of such a neglected side of pollination.},

The combination of Barrow data and data from tundra communities on Hardangervidda with primary production less than 600 gm-2 yr-1 shows no significant correlation between aboveground phytomass and primary productivity, whereas a weak positive trend is obtained from Truelove Lowland where the herbivore trophic level is impoverished. Data from Kilpisjarvi suggest an 8.4-fold increase in moss phytomasses during 7 yr of low lemming densities.

With increased potential productivity, the role of predation in herbivore regulation should become more important and the impact of herbivory upon plant communities should decrease. In very productive environments, increase in herbivory pressure is again probable, at least in aquatic ecosystems. The predicted pattern of phytomass and predicted results of manipulations are compared with available data. A reasonable fit between predictions and observations is found, although the sparsity of data and methodological uncertainties weaken the corroboration in several cases. In terrestrial ecosystems, the present version of the model seems best applicable to the vertebrate branch of the grazing chain, whereas the arthropod branch may be more sensitive to temperature than to average annual productivity.},

Properties of 2-mode networks and their derived 1-mode networks are highly correlated and so are properties of 1-mode pollinator and 1-mode plant networks. Most network properties are scale-dependent, i.e. they are dependent upon network size. Pollinationnetworks have the strongest small-world properties of any networks yet studied, i.e. all species are close to each other (short average path length) and species are highly clustered. Species in pollinationnetworks are much more densely linked than species in traditional food webs, i.e. they have a higher density of links, a shorter distance between species, and species are more clustered.},

Yet, understanding network dynamics is important in order to relate network patterns to ecological processes. We studied the day-to-day dynamics of an {Arctic} pollination interaction network over two consecutive seasons. First, we found that new species entering the network tend to interact with already well-connected species, although there are deviations from this trend due, for example, to morphological mismatching between plant and pollinator traits and nonoverlapping phenophases of plant and pollinator species. Thus, temporal dynamics provides a mechanistic explanation for previously reported network patterns such as the heterogeneous distribution of number of interactions across species. Second, we looked for the ecological properties most likely to be mediating this dynamical process and found that both abundance and phenophase length were important determinants of the number of links per species.},

is a common pattern in this type of interaction. Here we examine the ecological
correlates of generalization patterns in plant-pollinator networks, especially how interaction
patterns covary with latitude, elevation, and insularity. We review the few published analyses
of whole networks and include unpublished material, analyzing 29 complete plant-
pollinator networks that encompass {Arctic}, {Alpine}, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical-
tropical areas. The number of interactions observed (I) was a linear function of network
size (M) the maximum number of interactions: ln I 5 0.575 1 0.61 lnM; R2 5 0.946. The
connectance (C), the fraction of observed interactions relative to the total possible, decreased
exponentially with species richness, the sum of animal and plant species in each community
(A 1 P): C 5 13.83 exp[20.003(A 1 P)]. After controlling for species richness, the residual
connectance was significantly lower in highland (.1500 m elevation) than in lowland
networks and differed marginally among biogeographic regions, with both {Alpine} and tropical
networks showing a trend for lower residual connectance. The two Mediterranean
networks showed the highest residual connectance. After correcting for variation in network
size, plant species were shown to be more generalized at higher latitude and lowland habitats,
but showed increased specialization on islands. Oceanic island networks showed an impoverishment
of potential animal pollinators (lower ratio of animal to plant species, A : P,
compared to mainland networks) associated with this trend of increased specialization.
Plants, but not their flower-visiting animals, supported the often-repeated statements about
higher specificity in the tropics than at higher latitudes. The pattern of interaction buildup
as diversity increases in pollination networks does not differ appreciably from other
mutualisms, such as plant-seed disperser networks or more complex food webs.},

  abstract  = {In natural communities, species and their interactions are often organized as nonrandom networks, showing distinct and repeated complex patterns. A prevalent, but poorly explored pattern is ecological modularity, with weakly interlinked subsets of species (modules), which, however, internally consist of strongly connected species. The importance of modularity has been discussed for a long time, but no consensus on its prevalence in ecological networks has yet been reached. Progress is hampered by inadequate methods and a lack of large datasets. We analyzed 51 pollination networks including almost 10,000 species and 20,000 links and tested for modularity by using a recently developed simulated annealing algorithm. All networks with >150 plant and pollinator species were modular, whereas networks with <50 species were never modular. Both module number and size increased with species number. Each module includes one or a few species groups with convergent trait sets that may be considered as coevolutionary units. Species played different roles with respect to modularity. However, only 15% of all species were structurally important to their network. They were either hubs (i.e., highly linked species within their own module), connectors linking different modules, or both. If these key species go extinct, modules and networks may break apart and initiate cascades of extinction. Thus, species serving as hubs and connectors should receive high conservation priorities.},

  abstract  = {Plant–pollinator mutualistic networks represent the ecological context of foraging (for pollinators) and reproduction (for plants and some pollinators). Plant–pollinator visitation networks exhibit highly conserved structural properties across diverse habitats and species assemblages. The most successful hypotheses to explain these network properties are the neutrality and biological constraints hypotheses, which posit that species interaction frequencies can be explained by species relative abundances, and trait mismatches between potential mutualists respectively. However, previous network analyses emphasize the prediction of metrics of qualitative network structure, which may not represent stringent tests of these hypotheses. Using a newly documented temporally explicit alpine plant–pollinator visitation network, we show that metrics of both qualitative and quantitative network structure are easy to predict, even by models that predict the identity or frequency of species interactions poorly. A variety of phenological and morphological constraints as well as neutral interactions successfully predicted all network metrics tested, without accurately predicting species observed interactions. Species phenology alone was the best predictor of observed interaction frequencies. However, all models were poor predictors of species pairwise interaction frequencies, suggesting that other aspects of species biology not generally considered in network studies, such as reproduction for dipterans, play an important role in shaping plant–pollinator visitation network structure at this site. Future progress in explaining the structure and dynamics of mutualistic networks will require new approaches that emphasize accurate prediction of species pairwise interactions rather than network metrics, and better reflect the biology underlying species interactions.},

  abstract  = {Climate change is increasingly altering the composition of ecological communities, in combination with other environmental pressures such as high-intensity land use. Pressures are expected to interact in their effects, but the extent to which intensive human land use constrains community responses to climate change is currently unclear. A generic indicator of climate change impact, the community temperature index (CTI), has previously been used to suggest that both bird and butterflies are successfully ‘tracking’ climate change. Here, we assessed community changes at over 600 English bird or butterfly monitoring sites over three decades and tested how the surrounding land has influenced these changes. We partitioned community changes into warm- and cold-associated assemblages and found that English bird communities have not reorganized successfully in response to climate change. CTI increases for birds are primarily attributable to the loss of cold-associated species, whilst for butterflies, warm-associated species have tended to increase. Importantly, the area of intensively managed land use around monitoring sites appears to influence these community changes, with large extents of intensively managed land limiting ‘adaptive’ community reorganization in response to climate change. Specifically, high-intensity land use appears to exacerbate declines in cold-adapted bird and butterfly species, and prevent increases in warm-associated birds. This has broad implications for managing landscapes to promote climate change adaptation.},

However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67% to 96% but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78% in temperate-zone communities to 94% in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5% of the estimated species-level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant-pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract  = {We have developed a habitat selection model based on central place foraging theory. An individual’s decision to include a patch in its habitat depends on the marginal fitness contribution of that patch, which is characterized by its quality and distance to the central place. The essence of the model we have developed is a fitness isocline which is a function of patch quality and travel time to the patch. It has two parameters: the maximum travel distance to a patch of infinite quality and a coefficient that appropriately scales quality by travel time. Patches falling below the isocline will have positive marginal fitness values and should be included in the habitat. The maximum travel distance depends on the availability and quality of patches, as well as on the forager’s life history, whereas the scaling parameter mostly depends on life history properties. Using the model, we derived a landscape quality metric (which can be thought of as a connectivity measure) that sums the values of available habitat in the landscape around a central place. We then fitted the two parameters to foraging data on breeding white storks (Ciconia ciconia) and estimated landscape quality, which correlated strongly with reproductive success. Landscape quality was then calculated for a larger region where re-introduction of the species is currently going on in order to demonstrate how this model can also be regarded as a species distribution model. In conclusion, we have built a general habitat selection model for central place foragers and a novel way of estimating landscape quality based on a behaviorally scaled connectivity metric.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Pollination by bees is important for food production. Recent concerns about the declines of both domestic and wild bees, calls for measures to promote wild pollinator populations in farmland. However, to be able to efficiently promote and prioritize between measures that benefit pollinators, such as modified land use, agri-environment schemes, or specific conservation measures, it is important to have a tool that accurately predicts how bees use landscapes and respond to such measures. In this paper we compare an existing model for predicting pollination (the “Lonsdorf model”), with an extension of a general model for habitat use of central place foragers (the “CPF model”). The Lonsdorf model has been shown to perform relatively well in simple landscapes, but not in complex landscapes. We hypothesized that this was because it lacks a behavioral component, assuming instead that bees in essence diffuse out from the nest into the landscape. By adding a behavioral component, the \{CPF\} model in contrast assumes that bees only use those parts of the landscape that enhances their fitness, completely avoiding foraging in other parts of the landscape. Because foraging is directed toward the most rewarding foraging habitat patches as determined by quality and distance, foraging habitat will include a wide range of forage qualities close to the nest, but a much narrower range farther away. We generate predictions for both simple and complex hypothetical landscapes, to illustrate the effect of including the behavioral rule, and for real landscapes. In the real landscapes the models give similar predictions for visitation rates in simple landscapes, but more different predictions in heterogeneous landscapes. We also analyze the consequences of introducing hedgerows near a mass-flowering crop field under each model. The Lonsdorf model predicts that any habitat improvement will enhance pollination of the crop. In contrast, the \{CPF\} model predicts that the hedgerow must provide good nesting sites, and not just foraging opportunities, for it to benefit pollination of the crop, because good forage quality alone may drain bees away from the field. Our model can be used to optimize pollinator mitigation measures in real landscapes.},

In the model, we separate between costs that are load-size dependent, i.e. a direct effect of the size of the load, and load-size independent effects, such as correlations between distance and patch qualities. We also distinguish between predictions of between- and within-environment comparisons. Foraging costs, giving-up densities and quitting harvest rates should almost always increase with distance with these effects amplified by increases in metabolic costs, predation risk and load-costs. With respect to load-size: when comparing foraging in patches within an environment, we should often expect smaller loads to be taken from distant patches (negative distance-load correlation). However, when comparing between environments, there should be a positive correlation between average distance and load-size.},

Bees, hoverflies and butterflies are taxa frequently studied as pollinators in agricultural and conservation contexts. Although there are many records of non-syrphid Diptera visiting flowers, they are generally not regarded as important pollinators. We use data from 30 pollen-transport networks and 71 pollinator-visitation networks to compare the importance of various flower-visiting taxa as pollen-vectors. We specifically compare non-syrphid Diptera and Syrphidae to determine whether neglect of the former in the literature is justified. We found no significant difference in pollen-loads between the syrphid and non-syrphid Diptera. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the level of specialization between the two groups in the pollen-transport networks, though the Syrphidae had significantly greater visitation evenness. Flower visitation data from 33 farms showed that non-syrphid Diptera made up the majority of the flower-visiting Diptera in the agricultural studies (on average 82\% abundance and 73\% species richness), and we estimate that non-syrphid Diptera carry 84\% of total pollen carried by farmland Diptera. As important pollinators, such as bees, have suffered serious declines, it would be prudent to improve our understanding of the role of non-syrphid Diptera as pollinators.},

Included were one highland and two lowland sites that were dominated by one or two species of trees. All stands were tall, undisturbed forests, but some were surrounded by agricultural land. The number of species of birds recorded was not measurably affected by the tree species diversity or the length of the dry season. However, a larger proportion (about 90%) of the total forest species known to occur in the region as a whole was found in the drier areas, whereas only about 50% were recorded in the wetter areas. This suggests that @'between-habitat@' diversity@' may be greater in the areas with less severe dry seasons. The highland sites and markedly fewer species than the lowland sites, and a greater percentage of the species foraged by moving actively than was the case in the lowland sites. The large number of tropical lowland forest species that hunt by sitting and waiting for prey to move can probably be attributed to lack of wind, larger leaf size, larger biomass and higher recruitment rates of insects, more large nocturnal insects and more arboreal reptiles and amphibians. Many species of birds were limited to narrow vertical ranges in the forests, but the great increase in numbers of species in the tropics is only in small part accounted for by finer vertical subdivision of the forest. The greatest contribution is made by the addition of species with no temperate counterparts, suggesting that the greater range of resource types permanently above threshold values in tropical forests is the major cause of increased bird species diversity.},

2. We investigated the foraging range and constancy of two colonies of bumble bees Bombus terrestris L. on a mixed arable farm using harmonic radar, which has a unique capability to record the trajectories of insects flying at low altitude in the field. 
3. Foraging bees were fitted with lightweight radar transponders and tracked as they flew to and from the nest to forage. The resulting tracks gave information on length, direction and straightness of foraging routes. Superimposition onto a map of the foraging landscape allowed interpretation of the bees' destinations in relation to the spatial distribution of forage. 
4. Outward tracks had a mean length of 275.3 ± 18.5 m (n - 65) and a range of 70-631 m, and were often to forage destinations beyond the nearest available forage. Most bees were constant to compass bearing and destination over successive trips, although one bee was tracked apparently switching between forage patches. Both outward and return tracks had a mean straightness ratio of 0.93 ± 0.01 (n = 99). The bees' ground speeds ranged from 3.0 m s-1 to 15.7 m s-1 (n = 100) in a variety of wind conditions.
5. The results support the hypothesis that bumble bees do not necessarily forage close to their nest, and illustrate that studies on a landscape scale are required if we are to evaluate bee foraging ranges fully with respect to resource availability. Such evaluations are required to underpin assessments of gene flow in bee-pollinated crops and wild flowers. They are also required when making decisions about the management of bees as pollinators and the conservation of bee and plant biodiversity.},

  abstract  = {1. Foraging range is a key aspect of the ecology of ‘central place foragers’. Estimating how far bees fly under different circumstances is essential for predicting colony success, and for estimating bee-mediated gene flow between plant populations. It is likely to be strongly influenced by forage distribution, something that is hard to quantify in all but the simplest landscapes; and theories of foraging distance tend to assume a homogeneous forage distribution.
2. We quantified the distribution of bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. foragers away from experimentally positioned colonies, in an agricultural landscape, using two methods. We mass-marked foragers as they left the colony, and analysed pollen from foragers returning to the colonies. The data were set within the context of the ‘forage landscape’: a map of the spatial distribution of forage as determined from remote-sensed data. To our knowledge, this is the first time that empirical data on foraging distances and forage availability, at this resolution and scale, have been collected and combined for bumblebees.
3. The bees foraged at least 1.5 km from their colonies, and the proportion of foragers flying to one field declined, approximately linearly, with radial distance. In this landscape there was great variation in forage availability within 500 m of colonies but little variation beyond 1 km, regardless of colony location.
4. The scale of B. terrestris foraging was large enough to buffer against effects of forage patch and flowering crop heterogeneity, but bee species with shorter foraging ranges may experience highly variable colony success according to location.},

  abstract  = {The conservation of insect pollinators is drawing attention because of reported declines in bee species and the ‘ecosystem services’ they provide. This issue has been brought to a head by recent devastating losses of honey bees throughout North America (so called, ‘Colony Collapse Disorder’); yet, we still have little understanding of the cause(s) of bee declines. Wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) have also suffered serious declines and circumstantial evidence suggests that pathogen ‘spillover’ from commercially reared bumble bees, which are used extensively to pollinate greenhouse crops, is a possible cause. We constructed a spatially explicit model of pathogen spillover in bumble bees and, using laboratory experiments and the literature, estimated parameter values for the spillover of Crithidia bombi, a destructive pathogen commonly found in commercial Bombus. We also monitored wild bumble bee populations near greenhouses for evidence of pathogen spillover, and compared the fit of our model to patterns of C. bombi infection observed in the field. Our model predicts that, during the first three months of spillover, transmission from commercial hives would infect up to 20% of wild bumble bees within 2 km of the greenhouse. However, a travelling wave of disease is predicted to form suddenly, infecting up to 35-100% of wild Bombus, and spread away from the greenhouse at a rate of 2 km/wk. In the field, although we did not observe a large epizootic wave of infection, the prevalences of C. bombi near greenhouses were consistent with our model. Indeed, we found that spillover has allowed C. bombi to invade several wild bumble bee species near greenhouses. Given the available evidence, it is likely that pathogen spillover from commercial bees is contributing to the ongoing decline of wild Bombus in North America. Improved management of domestic bees, for example by reducing their parasite loads and their overlap with wild congeners, could diminish or even eliminate pathogen spillover.},

  abstract            = {Tilman's model predicts an asymmetric relationship, with ascending, peak, and descending parts, between plant species diversity and a resource gradient. I evaluated the applicability of Tilman's model to mammals by regressing rodent and carnivore species diversity on estimates of net aboveground primary productivity. Rodent diversity was highest at low productivity levels and declined as productivity increased. Although my data did not confirm the upslope and peak phases of Tilman's model, this may be because I did not sample from areas of extremely low productivity. Published studies from very dry desert habitats indicate that rodent diversity increases rapidly across a narrow gradient of very low productivity and peaks at moderately low levels. This suggests that rodents, which are largely herbivorous, exhibit an asymmetric productivity-diversity curve similar to that predicted by Tilman for plants. The rodent data are also consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, which predicts diversity as a peaked function of a disturbance gradient. Rainfall predictability, which may function as a disturbance, is inversely related to my plant productivity gradient. The regression curve for carnivores helps to distinguish between these two hypotheses. At a given locality carnivores and rodents should be exposed to about the same disturbance levels and according to the intermediate disturbance model should peak at about the same place. Since carnivores as a whole are about one trophic level above rodents, if plant productivity controls diversity the peak for carnivores should occur at about an order of magnitude of productivity higher than the peak for rodents. My carnivore diversity data exhibit upslope, peak, and downslope phases and are shifted to higher levels of productivity by about one order of magnitude. This provides evidence against the intermediate disturbance hypotheses and corroborates predictions of Tilman's model as applied to mammals.},

The first one supposes that larger animals are superior competitors because of their increased feeding abilities, whereas the second one assumes superiority of smaller animals because of their lower food requirements. We examined the relationship between two unrelated species of different size, drinking technique, energy requirements and roles in plant pollination system, to reveal the features of their competitive interaction and mechanisms enabling their co-existence while utilising the same nectar source. We observed diurnal feeding behaviour of the main pollinator, the carpenter bee Xylocopa caffra and a nectar thief, the northern double-collared sunbird Cinnyris reichenowi on 19 clumps of Hypoestes aristata (Acanthaceae) in Bamenda Highlands, Cameroon. For comparative purpose, we established a simplistic model of daily energy expenditure and daily energy intake by both visitor species assuming that they spend all available daytime feeding on H. aristata. We revealed the energetic gain--expenditure balance of the studied visitor species in relation to diurnal changes in nectar quality and quantity. In general, smaller energy requirements and related ability to utilise smaller resources made the main pollinator X. caffra competitively superior to the larger nectar thief C. reichenowi. Nevertheless, sunbirds are endowed with several mechanisms to reduce asymmetry in exploitative competition, such as the use of nectar resources in times of the day when rivals are inactive, aggressive attacks on carpenter bees while defending the nectar plants, and higher speed of nectar consumption.},

  abstract  = {1. The effect of climate change on wild bee communities is of major concern since the decline of bee species could imperil the provision of pollination services. Additionally, habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to wild bee populations, but improvements to the landscape structure could also improve the general conditions for wild bees. However, potential interactive effects of climate change and landscape structure on wild bee communities remain unknown.
2. In this study, we assessed the potential of semi-natural areas to maintain robust communities under changing weather conditions. We used bee monitoring data from six 4 × 4 km field sites across Germany. Almost 30 000 bee specimens were collected from 2010 to 2012 in 16 local communities per site at six sampling occasions per year. Following a multimodel inference approach, we identified the most important weather and landscape variables as well as interaction terms that affect wild bee species richness and total abundance.
3. Correcting for overall phenology, we found a strong negative relationship between bee species richness and temperature, indicating that future increasing temperatures will lead to a decrease in species richness. However, a high proportion of semi-natural habitats can considerably decrease the detrimental effect of warmer temperatures on bee species richness and abundance.
4. Synthesis and applications. Semi-natural areas and green infrastructure elements within agricultural landscapes become even more important under changing temperature conditions to mitigate the negative effects of increasing temperatures on wild bee species richness and total abundance. This has important implications for conservation decision making, suggesting that maintaining or restoring a fair amount of semi-natural areas could serve as a countermeasure against climate change for wild bees.},

  abstract  = {The spatial distribution of fertilization rates achieved by male dung flies around cattle droppings is examined in relation to dropping age. Where there is no territoriality, sexual selection should result in the fertilization rates per male being equal in each search area at a given dropping age. The three sources of gain (fertilizations) for a male Scatophaga are newly arriving females, take-overs of ovipositing females, and take-overs of copulating females. All arriving females are mated before they oviposit, and after a take-over (where the paired male is ousted) the successful male mates almost immediately. During early stages after deposition, search strategy is mainly influenced by gains from incoming females. As predicted, female capture rates per male appear to be equal in a series of zones within the reproductive area. However, as the dropping ages male strategy is influenced considerably by possible gains from take-overs, especially of ovipositing females. The relative availability at a given dropping age of females in the different phases can be derived from previous data. The probability of capture of an incoming female in the grass (rather than on the dung surface) increases with the number of males searching there to a maximum value of .8. By fitting curves to this and other relationships which are dependent on number of males in the reproductive area, a model is developed which predicts the expected proportions of males searching in the grass and on the dung in relation to two variables, dropping age and total searching males. The model assumes that search strategies are in equilibrium, with gain rates equal in the grass and on the dung. Gain rate = egg gain from a given mating (calculated from a model for natural sperm competition developed previously; Parker 1970a) divided by reproductive time taken to achieve this gain. The predicted search profile (percentage males searching in grass plotted against dropping age and male density) is close to the observed profile, suggesting that the model is a reasonable simulation of the selective pressures involved. The significance of a disparity between observed and expected (at low male density early after deposition) is discussed. Female arrival behavior is an important determinant of the male strategy; generally females approach the dung indirectly (fly upwind first). Struggles between males at the time a female is encountered are commonest in high male density, and occur more often when females approach directly. When encounter occurs in the grass, the male usually flies the female to an area of lower male density; this may be of selective advantage in terms of reducing the probability of take-over. Grass and dung searching are not discrete genetic strategies; each male moves repeatedly between the two localities. This, and the implications of the present study are discussed in relation to 'resource assessment' and sexually selected territoriality.},

(2) A character of selective advantage in terms of sexual selection (fighting for females) may therefore evolve even though it appears to lower the overall reproductive rate of the species (by increasing the generation time). (3) The fertilization rate (number of eggs fertilized by a male in unit time) achieved by males around the dropping is about 0.23 eggs/male/min, hence the selective disadvantage (in terms of sexual selection) to a male of `time waste' at the dropping would be considerable. (4) The average `search time' (time taken for a male to obtain a female at the dropping) is about 140 min. (5) The average fertilization rate of male S. stercoraria is dependent on the sex ratio around the dung, which is apparently unaffected by seasonal changes in population density. (6) It is postulated that in conditions of sexual competition where males are searching for females, an evolutionary `equilibrium position' should eventually be established where all males achieve an approximately equal fertilization rate. The fertilization rate per male in S. stercoraria appears to be in equilibrium in that it is equally distributed with time after the dropping is deposited, i.e. temporal equilibrium is established. (7) Males around cattle pastures appear to mate about three times per day, and the duration of copula of a given male decreases with successive matings but returns to normal the next day. (8) Searching for females occurs both on the dropping and in the surrounding grass. About 90% of the males searching in the grass do so up-wind of the dropping. Females appear usually to fly over the dropping and then walk towards it, with the wind. (9) The `pat change interval' (time taken for a male to find a fresh pat) probably approximates to 4 min. (10) The observed relationship between time spent searching on the dung surface and that spent in the surrounding grass may also represent an `equilibrium distribution' of fertilization rate whereby equal fertilization rates are achieved in the two localities. Thus spatial equilibrium may also be established, though this remains to be analysed quantitatively.},

  abstract  = {A series of prospective models is developed to investigate ideal free distributions in populations where individuals differ in competitive ability. The models are of three types. In the continuous-input models, there is continuous arrival of food or mates into each habitat patch, and competitors scramble to obtain as large a share as possible. In the interference models, the prey density in a particular patch stays constant but the presence of competitors slows down the rate at which prey are captured. In the kleptoparasitism model, individuals have food or females stolen from them by competitors higher in the dominance hierarchy, and in turn steal items from subordinates. A general result of the continuous-input and interference models is that the population of competitors can be truncated between patches so that the individuals with the highest competitive ability occur in the best patches, or in the patches where competitive differences are greatest. Individuals of lowest competitive ability occur in the poorest patches or where competitive differences are least, and intermediate phenotypes are ranked between these two extremes. Thus the ideal free prediction that all individuals will achieve equal fitness will not apply. However, in continuous-input cases where competitive differences between phenotypes remain constant across patches, this solution is only neutrally stable, and forms only one element of a set of equilibrium distributions. The fact that many empirical studies of continuous-input have found approximately equal mean fitness across patches may relate to this finding. Most interference studies contradict the simple ideal free solution by having different mean intake rates across patches; this may relate to the predicted positive correlation of competitive ability with patch quality. The kleptoparasitism model usually generated continuous cycling of individuals between habitat patches, though some correlation could be found between competitive ability and patch quality.},

We investigated how environmental change affects flower visitation and pollination with a field study simulating pollinator habitat loss (distance to semi-natural habitat), phenological shift (anticipated flowering) and environmentally induced growth (enhanced flower height). We established 16 habitat islands of potted plants of Sinapis arvensis L., recorded all flower visitors (mainly bees, flies and pollen beetles) and quantified the seed set. Experimentally elevated flowers were less often visited by flies, while visitation by bees was not affected. Further, plants distant from calcareous grassland were less often visited by bees but visitation by flies did not decrease. Anticipated flowering reduced the number of both pollinators and herbivorous pollen beetles and increased the reproductive success (seeds per plant) of S. arvensis, showing that the loss of mutualists was compensated by an escape from antagonists. During the natural flowering period more seeds were produced close to grasslands, especially by plants of natural height, presumably due to the higher bee visitation rate. However, seed production appeared to be relatively tolerant to multiple environmental changes due to complementary patterns among the different flower visitor guilds. Our results suggest complex interactions of environmental change with responses of mutualists and antagonists, making general predictions difficult.},

Exclosures were constructed around both study areas to protect them from livestock grazing during the 2 years of the study. There was 45% more top growth in the protected area but only 68% as much root mass; consequently, average annual net production was at least 12% greater in the grazed area. Irrigation with 9 cm water increased top-growth yield 41.4%. Although over 30 species of plants were present in each community, two species contributed over half of the annual production in both areas. In the protected community 65% and in the grazed community 80% of the plant mass was underground. Proportion of plant mass underground ranged from 55% to over 98% in individual plants excavated whole. Following harvesting of the tops, dry weight of the roots decreased 1.6% during the first week, 22.1% during the first month, and 31.3% during the first 8 months. To measure seasonal trends in productivity, six plots, each 1 m^2 in area, were harvested every week during two growing seasons. Artemisia tridentata, the principal shrub present, seemed to be most productive during the fall and early spring while Stipa comata, the principal grass, was most productive during late spring and early summer.},

The total sugar content of nectar samples was measured by the Dreywood anthrone reaction for total carbohydrate, and simple sugar composition was determined using an enzymatic bioanalysis for D-glucose, D-fructose and sucrose. Hybrid and open-pollinated cultivar flowers had similar sugar content. Mean total sugar content per flower also did not vary among hybrid breeding systems when compared within individual weeks of the bloom period or within daily sampling periods. However, for all cultivars, total nectar sugar content per flower was lower during the 08:00 and 11:00 h sampling periods and increased to maximum levels during the 14:00 and 16:00 h sampling periods. Significant differences in nectar sugar content were also found in relation to the bloom phenology of the cultivars. Cultivars produced the greatest amount of sugar per flower during the first 2 wk of the bloom period, then sugar production decreased in the third and fourth weeks. Nectar sugar ratios from all cultivars averaged approximately 1:1 glucose:fructose. Nectar glucose content among cultivars was similar but, among breeding systems, CMS cultivars tended to have lower amounts of glucose than SI or open-pollinated cultivars. Selecting for higher total sugar content may produce nectars more attractive to foraging honeybees (Apis mellifera L.), thereby ensuring adequate pollination of hybrid parental lines and F1 hybrid plants. Selecting for lower nectar glucose will produce honeys with more desirable granulation characteristics. Overall, the production and quality of nectar sugar in oilseed rape hybrids are similar to those of open-pollinated cultivars, and are not likely to adversely affect the pollinating activities of honeybees or their potential for honey production.},

  abstract  = {It is accepted that accurate estimation of risk of population extinction, or persistence time, requires prediction of the effect of fluctuations in the environment on population dynamics. Generally, the greater the magnitude, or variance, of environmental stochasticity, the greater the risk of population extinction. Another characteristic of environmental stochasticity, its colour, has been found to affect population persistence. This is important because real environmental variables, such as temperature, are reddened or positively temporally autocorrelated. However, recent work has disagreed about the effect of reddening environmental stochasticity. Ripa and Lundberg (1996) found increasing temporal autocorrelation (reddening) decreased the risk of extinction, whereas a simple and powerful intuitive argument (Lawton 1988) predicts increased risk of extinction with reddening. This study resolves the apparent contradiction, in two ways, first, by altering the dynamic behaviour of the population models. Overcompensatory dynamics result in persistence times increasing with increased temporal autocorrelation; undercompensatory dynamics result in persistence times decreasing with increased temporal autocorrelation. Secondly, in a spatially subdivided population, with a reasonable degree of spatial heterogeneity in patch quality, increasing temporal autocorrelation in the environment results in decreasing persistence time for both types of competition. Thus, the inclusion of coloured noise into ecological models can have subtle interactions with population dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {Pollinators provide an important service in many crops. Managed honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) are used to supplement pollination services provided by wild bees with the assumption that they will enhance pollination, fruit set and crop yield beyond the levels provided by the wild bees. Recent declines in managed honey bee populations have stimulated interest in finding alternative managed pollinators to service crops. In the eastern U.S., managed hives of the native common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) may be an excellent choice. To examine this issue, a comprehensive 2-yr study was conducted to compare fruit yield and bee visits to flowers in pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) fields that were either supplemented with A. mellifera hives, B. impatiens hives or were not supplemented. We compared pumpkin yield, A. mellifera flower visitation frequency and B. impatiens flower visitation frequency between treatments. Results indicated that supplementing pumpkin fields with either A. mellifera or B. impatiens hives did not increase their visitation to pumpkin flowers or fruit yield compared with those that were not supplemented. Next, the relationship between frequency of pumpkin flower visitation by the most prominent bee species (Peponapis pruinosa (Say), B. impatiens and A. mellifera) and fruit yield was determined across all pumpkin fields sampled. Fruit yield increased as the frequency of flower visits by A. mellifera and B. impatiens increased in 2011 and 2012, respectively. These results suggest that supplementation with managed bees may not improve pumpkin production and that A. mellifera and B. impatiens are important pollinators of pumpkin in our system.},

For example, the sex ratio theory predicts variation in equal investment in each sex when the maternal fitness gains from increased investment differ between sexes. Changing sex allocation because of changing payoffs may result from different ecological situations, such as foraging conditions. We investigated the impact of foraging travel cost on relative investment in sons vs daughters. Field studies were carried out with the central-place-foraging leafcutter bee Megachile rotundata (Fabricius), which has smaller males than females. Therefore, less investment is required to produce a viable son compared with a daughter. We found that with increased flight distance to resources, females produced a greater proportion of sons. Females also invested fewer resources in individual sons and daughters and produced fewer offspring with increased flight distance.},

P. kanei), P. hirsuta, P. flammea, and P. lapponica in West Greenland. Pedicularis lanata depends on insects for seed set. P. hirsuta and P. flammea are able to set seed by autodeposition, but P. flammea less successfully than P. hirsuta. Pedicularis lapponica mainly propagates vegetatively. Insects are rarely seen visiting the four species in the investigated area. In P. lanata the number of germinated pollen grains per stigma is much lower on average than the number of ovules per ovary, and the seed set is consequently well below its potential. Accordingly, we believe that pollen availability limits seed. Multispiked individuals of P. lanata have a lower seed set and a higher mortality rate than single-spiked plants. Pedicularis hirsuta allocates most resources to reproduction and has the highest P/O-ratio and relative reproductive success (RRS) in the area, thus being the most successful species of the four regarding seed production. Pedicularis lanata has the lowest relative reproductive success of the three sexually reproducing species due to low seed set. The four species possess flowers adapted for insect pollination, but are using different and alternative means to maintain populations: vegetative propagation, autogamy, visits by unspecialized insects, and by being perennial.},

  abstract            = {I studied various aspects of the life history of Cnemidophorus tigris over much of its geographic range, from southern Idaho through southern Arizona and into northern Sonora. In the northern parts of its range, Cnemidophorus usually emerge from hibernation in May, and most adults aestivate during the midsummer months, but in the south the animals are active from April through late August. The seasonal period of activity is therefore considerably shorter in the north. Daily periods of activity are of similar duration from north to south, although the time of emergence tends to be later on northern areas. There is a significant positive correlation between estimated abundance and the total precipitation during the last 5 years, suggesting that the abundance of this species is determined by food supply. There is a latitudinal cline in the mean body temperature of active lizards, with northern populations being active at lower air and body temperature. Whereas termites constitute the major food of southern lizards, beetles and grasshoppers are the primary food of northern lizards. Some seasonal dietary trends are described. The numbers and biomass of predatory lizards, birds, and snakes increase from north to south; correlated with this is a latitudinal increase in the percentage of lizards with broken regenerated tails. Hence there is probably greater predation on southern lizards. The length of fat bodies in C. tigris is not correlated with latitude but shows an inverse correlation with the long-term average annual precipitation. It is suggested that lizards from less productive areas must allow themselves a greater margin of safety due to the more probable occurrence of drought. Northern lizards breed only once during the short northern season but lay significantly larger clutches than southern lizards, which lay at least two clutches annually. Clutch size appears to be flexible in response to feeding conditions; in one study area with a low long-term mean precipitation, females laid larger clutches during the second year, after supranormal rainfall. There is a significant correlation between mean number of eggs per clutch and the deviation of the short term (last 5 years) mean precipitation from the long-term mean precipitation. A number of facts suggest that there was a decided population @'crash@' on one study area during the period of study. Competition is briefly discussed and it is suggested that if there is any latitudinal trend, it is most likely in the direction of greater competition among southern lizards. In the conclusions, I suggest that the ecological challenges facing the northern populations are primarily physical, largely climatic ones, biotic interactions (particularly predation) assume relatively greater importance to southern lizards.},

Experiments were conducted in confinement in an indoor flight room with controlled conditions and in an outdoor flight cage with conditions more representative of the open environment. Foraging behaviour was analysed by observations of general bee behaviour (total number of visits) and of individual bee behaviour (using a video camera coupled with a special software program to process the data). The plants were analysed in terms of nectar quantity and quality (nectar volume and sugar content). The results showed no effects on bee foraging behaviour due to the modification of the genome of these plants by the introduction of a chitinase gene even though some differences between lines were found in the nectar. The methods applied in this original approach for the evaluation of the impact of genetically modified oilseed rape were shown to be sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in bee behaviour resulting from differences between plants.},

The criticisms are independent and presented in decreasing order of importance. We argue that optimization theory is inappropriate for investigating the products of evolution, that animals should not be expected to be optimal, that it is not possible to test whether they are optimal. We further suggest that it is not possible to test whether behaviour has been selected to fulfil specific functions, that such tests have not been carried out, and that no optimization model of foraging behaviour has been supported. Appeals to the heuristic value of the theory are inappropriate because they encourage unjustified interpretations of the behaviour of animals.},

The number of insects per 1000 available flowers was counted for the four main pollinators: honeybees, bumblebees, solitary bees, and Diptera. Additionally, on ‘Falcon’/‘Falcon pat ’ the foraging behaviour of the main pollinating insects, i.e., honeybees and bumblebees, was observed (number of flowers visited per min, foraging postures, intervariety flights). A pleiotropic effect could affect nectar and pollen production, therefore we measured nectar volume, nectar sugar concentration, and composition for the four plant genotypes, and on ‘Falcon’ and ‘Falcon pat ’ pollen production was also estimated. The diversity and density of the foraging insect population observed on the transgenic genotypes were similar to that on the non-transgenic controls. Moreover, the foraging behaviour strategy was similar on ‘Falcon’ and ‘Falcon pat ’, and honeybees flew indifferently across these two genotypes. No difference was found in nectar and pollen between the genotypes. Thus, we may assume that the insects do not discriminate between conventional and transgenic oilseed rape specifically resistant to glufosinate. A case-by-case approach is recommended for other genetic modifications to plants potentially visited by bees.},

  abstract  = {The genotypic variability in nectar secretion among 71 genotypes of winter oilseed rapes was tested for floral nectar volume, sugar composition and concentration. Differences were found between seed quality genotypes: double low [00] oilseed rape varieties tended to secrete much more nectar than single low [0+] and double high [++] varieties. Male-sterile lines (Ogura CMS) secreted one-half to one-third the amount of their isogenic male-fertile counterparts. Restored lines behaved as conventional rape varieties. On average, amounts of nectar were 2 ul/flower and ranged from 0.7 to 6 ul/flower. Among the genotypes under test, the male-sterile lines were not the least productive. The analysis of (Samourai) winter oilseed rape showed that total sugar concentrations in nectar were highest at the beginning of the flowering period (30g/100 ml) and lowest towards the end (10g/100 ml). At a given date, total sugar contents in nectar of [0 +] varieties were significantly higher than those of [++] varieties and were due to higher fructose contents. Differences between genotypes within the same type also occurred, depending on the day of sampling. Oilseed rape nectar was confirmed to be predominantly composed of hexose (glucose and fructose). From the results of these investigations, it is concluded that the opportunity exists to select oilseed rape genotypes, including male-sterile lines, that secrete sufficient amounts of nectar to attract honey-bees to ensure pollination of male-sterile lines for hybrid seed production.},

Number of flowers/m2 and nectar volumes, considered as important attractive factors, did not differ between the two lines but nectar sugar composition was slightly different. Honeybee density was significantly higher on the apetalous line when their foraging activity was rather high. Honeybees showed a considerable constancy to each flower type. Passages between both types were not very frequent. Nectar foraging behaviour, observed under cages, differed with the floral morphology. On the apetalous flowers, honeybees visited the two inner nectaries by crawling over the anthers and the stigma, while on the apetalous ones they often inserted their tongues between the sepals, thus having less contact with the reproductive organs. From these results, the honeybee efficiency in cross-pollination between petalous and apetalous lines appears to be reduced.},

rape pollination. During that years, the cultivars diversified and with them the pollination needs. Two
apparently contradictory purposes were followed: i) to optimize the pollen transfer to produce hybrid
seed, ii) to reduce pollen transfer to warrant pure seeds production or to limit GMO pollen dispersal.
Knowing that pollen transfers are dur to insects and wind, the role of the two vectors was respectively
studied. Briefly here we show that the role of insects has often been underestimated even in the
pollination of conventional (hermaphroditic) oilseed rape and that the pollen of oilseed rape is not
suited to wind dispersal and is therefore transported at only short distance.},

We investigated the role of foraging honeybees in making this pollen airborne. To assess this, six cages were laid over male-fertile (MF) and male-sterile (MS) plants; at flowering, three cages received a honeybee colony while the others served as controls. On average, approximately 25% more pollen grains were deposited on sticky slides (covered with gauze) in cages with honeybees, compared to control cages. The fruit and seed set per not-empty pod of 5 MS plants bagged under gauze to avoid bee visits were 7 times and 3.4 times higher, respectively, in the cages with honeybees than in control cages without honeybees. These results demonstrate the role of bees in releasing airborne pollen, as well as the effectiveness of this insect-assisted wind pollination: at close range, honeybees participate to pollination without touching the female flowers.ma},

  abstract  = {Learning and memory are crucial functions which enable insect pollinators to efficiently locate and extract floral rewards. Exposure to pesticides or infection by parasites may cause subtle but ecologically important changes in cognitive functions of pollinators. The potential interactive effects of these stressors on learning and memory have not yet been explored. Furthermore, sensitivity to stressors may differ between species, but few studies have compared responses in different species. Here, we show that chronic exposure to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid clothianidin impaired olfactory learning acquisition in honeybees, leading to potential impacts on colony fitness, but not in bumblebees. Infection by the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae slightly impaired learning in honeybees, but no interactive effects were observed. Nosema did not infect bumblebees (3\% infection success). Nevertheless, Nosema-treated bumblebees had a slightly lower rate of learning than controls, but faster learning in combination with neonicotinoid exposure. This highlights the potential for complex interactive effects of stressors on learning. Our results underline that one cannot readily extrapolate findings from one bee species to others. This has important implications for regulatory risk assessments which generally use honeybees as a model for all bees.},

The most common ALCB management practice is the loose cell system, in which cocooned bees are removed from nesting cavities for cleaning and storage. Traits of ALCBs that favored their commercialization include gregarious nesting; use of leaves for lining nests; ready acceptance of affordable, mass-produced nesting materials; alfalfa pollination efficacy; and emergence synchrony with alfalfa bloom. The ALCB became a commercial success because much of its natural history was understood, targeted research was pursued, and producer ingenuity was encouraged. The ALCB presents a model system for commercializing other solitary bees and for advancing new testable hypotheses in diverse biological disciplines.},

  abstract  = {The risk exposure of bee colonies to the toxicity of systemic neonicotinoid insecticides was assessed. Various methods of chemical prevention of commercial winter and spring oilseed rape crops in field-realistic conditions were taken into account in the assessment. Pesticides were applied in accordance with the actual agricultural practice. Commercial crop protection products with thiamethoxam, clothianidin or imidacloprid were used as seed treatment. Formulations containing acetamiprid or thiacloprid were used for spraying. Fifteen healthy bee colonies were placed in close proximity to each of the oilseed rape fields throughout the blooming period. During florescence, the samples of nectar (directly from flowers and nectar flow from combs) and pollen loads were collected repeatedly. Samples of honey, bee bread and adult bees were taken one week after the end of plants flowering. To ensure high specificity and sensitivity of analysed pestcicides modified QuEChERS extraction method and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used. The five of neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiametoxam, acetamiprid and thiacloprid) were analyzed in multi-residue method with 0.1 - 10 ng/g limits of detection. Palynological analysis was done to determine the botanical origin of the nectar, honey and pollen. Development of bee colonies (brood area, worker biomass, colony health) was assessed every 3 weeks until the end of the beekeeping season. The amount of pollen collected by bees per hive, bee bread area and rape honey yield was also measured. The long-term effects of insecticides on bees were estimated using the same methods in April of the following year.

All the neonicotinoid insecticides applied to control oilseed rape pests were present in the samples of nectar and pollen. Their residue levels were lower than the acute oral and contact LD50 values. Among five examined neonicotinoids, the most frequently detected were: thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and acetamiprid. These substances were present in 65, 64, and 51% of the nectar samples and in 37, 62, and 45% of the pollen samples, respectively. The highest level of residues were noted after the thiamethoxam seed treatment; on average, 4.2 and 3.8 ng/g in the nectar and pollen samples. In the nectar and pollen samples from winter rape fields, lower levels of neonicotinoid residues were found in comparison to spring rape samples. The contaminations of neonicotinoids applied as seed dressing in nectar samples were significantly higher in comparison to the pollen samples. No negative effects of neonicotinoids on the bee mortality, brood development, strength, and honey yield of healthy bee colonies were found throughout the study period. However, the risk exposure of bee colonies on adverse impact of pesticide residues is high in areas of intensively cultivated oilseed rape.},

The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difficulty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of beta-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up beta-diversity of community composition to the beta-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.},

  abstract  = {Understanding how climate change can affect crop-pollinator systems helps predict potential geographical mismatches between a crop and its pollinators, and therefore identify areas vulnerable to loss of pollination services. We examined the distribution of orchard species (apples, pears, plums and other top fruits) and their pollinators in Great Britain, for present and future climatic conditions projected for 2050 under the SRES A1B Emissions Scenario. We used a relative index of pollinator availability as a proxy for pollination service. At present there is a large spatial overlap between orchards and their pollinators, but predictions for 2050 revealed that the most suitable areas for orchards corresponded to low pollinator availability. However, we found that pollinator availability may persist in areas currently used for fruit production, but which are predicted to provide sub-optimal environmental suitability for orchard species in the future. Our results may be used to identify mitigation options to safeguard orchard production against the risk of pollination failure in Great Britain over the next 50 years; for instance choosing fruit tree varieties that are adapted to future climatic conditions, or boosting wild pollinators through improving landscape resources. Our approach can be readily applied to other regions and crop systems, and expanded to include different climatic scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Fire has a major impact on the structure and function of many ecosystems globally. Pyrodiversity, the diversity of fires within a region (where diversity is based on fire characteristics such as extent, severity, and frequency), has been hypothesized to promote biodiversity, but changing climate and land management practices have eroded pyrodiversity. To assess whether changes in pyrodiversity will have impacts on ecological communities, we must first understand the mechanisms that might enable pyrodiversity to sustain biodiversity, and how such changes might interact with other disturbances such as drought. Focusing on plant-pollinator communities in mixed-conifer forest with frequent fire in Yosemite National Park, California, we examine how pyrodiversity, combined with drought intensity, influences those communities. We find that pyrodiversity is positively related to the richness of the pollinators, flowering plants, and plant-pollinator interactions. On average, a 5% increase in pyrodiversity led to the gain of approximately one pollinator and one flowering plant species and nearly two interactions. We also find that a diversity of fire characteristics contributes to the spatial heterogeneity (beta-diversity) of plant and pollinator communities. Lastly, we find evidence that fire diversity buffers pollinator communities against the effects of drought-induced floral resource scarcity. Fire diversity is thus important for the maintenance of flowering plant and pollinator diversity and predicted shifts in fire regimes to include less pyrodiversity compounded with increasing drought occurrence will negatively influence the richness of these communities in this and other forested ecosystems. In addition, lower heterogeneity of fire severity may act to reduce spatial turnover of plant-pollinator communities. The heterogeneity of community composition is a primary determinant of the total species diversity present in a landscape, and thus, lower pyrodiversity may negatively affect the richness of plant-pollinator communities across large spatial scales.},

Unless the arrival rate of any forager at a patch is independent of previous arrivals at that patch, encountered crop does not equal standing crop. Pollination ecologists should be wary of using standing crop to measure encountered crop. When resources in a patch renew at a constant rate, systematic foraging (reducing the standard deviation but not the mean of the inter-arrival time) does not increase the mean resource abundance encountered by a forager. However, systematic foraging may increase the fitness of a territorial forager because it reduces mean standing crop and therefore intruder pressure, and systematic foraging may increase the fitness of a risk-averse forager because it reduces the standard deviation of encountered crop. When the rate of resource renewal in a patch depends on the amount of resource in that patch, systematic foraging alters the mean resource abundance encountered by a forager. In particular, when resources increase in a patch at a decreasing rate, systematic foraging increases mean encountered crop.},

The resource abundance of a patch is assumed to be dependent on two processes: renewal, a property of the environment and resource concerned, and depletion by a forager to a fixed minimum density. The modelling procedure is specifically applied to animals exploiting nectar in flowers although it may be more generally applicable. Each flower is considered to be a separate patch. The model enables us to predict the way in which the mean and standard deviation of nectar content varies with foraging intensity, and time (diurnal patterns). Factors affecting the relationship between the mean and standard deviation of flower nectar content are discussed. Diurnal variations in the mean and standard deviation of flower nectar content are emphasized. Data on sunbirds Nectarina spp. foraging on nectar in L. nepetifolia flowers (Gill and Wolf, 1977, Ecology 58, 1284–1296) is used to test aspects of the model.},

  abstract  = {In highly seasonal environments, offspring production by vertebrates is timed to coincide with the annual peak of resource availability. For herbivores, this resource peak is represented by the annual onset and progression of the plant growth season. As plant phenology advances in response to climatic warming, there is potential for development of a mismatch between the peak of resource demands by reproducing herbivores and the peak of resource availability. For migratory herbivores, such as caribou, development of a trophic mismatch is particularly likely because the timing of their seasonal migration to summer ranges, where calves are born, is cued by changes in day length, while onset of the plant-growing season on the same ranges is cued by local temperatures. Using data collected since 1993 on timing of calving by caribou and timing of plant growth in West Greenland, we document the consequences for reproductive success of a developing trophic mismatch between caribou and their forage plants. As mean spring temperatures at our study site have risen by more than 4C, caribou have not kept pace with advancement of the plant-growing season on their calving range. As a consequence, offspring mortality has risen and offspring production has dropped fourfold.},

We found consistent declines in colony numbers in central European countries and some increases in Mediterranean countries. Beekeeper numbers have declined in all of the European countries examined. Our data support the view that honey bees are in decline at least in some regions, which is probably closely linked to the decreasing number of beekeepers. Our data on colony numbers and beekeepers must, however, be interpreted with caution due to different approaches and socioeconomic factors in the various countries, thereby limiting their comparability. We therefore make specific recommendations for standardized methodologies to be adopted at the national and global level to assist in the future monitoring of honey bees.},

We present a novel and highly integrated approach, which quantifies, in parallel, the response to fire of pollinator communities, floral communities and floral reward structure. Mt Carmel, Israel is a recognised bee-flower biodiversity hotspot, and using a chronosequence of habitats with differing post-fire ages, we follow the changes in plant-pollinator community organisation from immediately following a burn until full regeneration of vegetation. Initially, fire has a catastrophic effect on these communities, however, recovery is rapid with a peak in diversity of both flowers and bees in the first 2 years post-fire, followed by a steady decline over the next 50 years. The regeneration of floral communities is closely matched by that of their principal pollinators. At the community level we quantify, per unit area of habitat, key parameters of nectar and pollen forage known to be of importance in structuring pollinator communities. Nectar volume, nectar water content, nectar concentration and the diversity of nectar foraging niches are all greatest immediately following fire with a steady decrease as regeneration proceeds. Temporal changes in energy availability for nectar, pollen, total energy (nectar + pollen) and relative importance of pollen to nectar energy show a similar general decline with site age, however, the pattern is less clear owing to the highly patchy distribution of floral resources. Changes in floral reward structure reflect the general shift from annuals (generally low-reward open access flowers) to perennials (mostly high-reward and restricted access flowers) as post-fire regeneration ensues. The impact of fire on floral communities and their associated rewards have clear implications for pollinator community structure and we discuss this and the role of other disturbance factors on these systems.},

  abstract  = {Pollinators provide essential ecosystem services, and declines in some pollinator communities around the world have been reported. Understanding the fundamental
components defining these communities is essential if conservation and restoration are to be successful. We examined the structure of plant–pollinator communities in a dynamic Mediterranean landscape, comprising a mosaic of post-fire regenerating habitats, and which is a recognized global hotspot for bee diversity. Each community was characterized by a highly skewed species abundance distribution, with a few dominant and many rare bee species, and was consistent with a log series model indicating that a few environmental factors govern the community.
Floral community composition, the quantity and quality of forage resources present, and the geographic locality organized bee communities at various levels: (1) The overall
structure of the bee community (116 species), as revealed through ordination, was dependent upon nectar resource diversity (defined as the variety of nectar volume-concentration combinations available), the ratio of pollen to nectar energy, floral diversity, floral abundance, and post-fire age. (2) Bee diversity, measured as species richness, was closely linked to floral diversity (especially of annuals), nectar resource diversity, and post-fire age of the habitat. (3) The abundance of the most common species was primarily related to post-fire age, grazing intensity, and nesting substrate availability. Ordination models based on agecharacteristic post-fire floral community structure explained 39–50% of overall variation observed in bee community structure. Cluster analysis showed that all the communities shared a high degree of similarity in their species composition (27–59%); however, the geographical location of sites also contributed a smaller but significant component to bee community structure.
We conclude that floral resources act in specific and previously unexplored ways to modulate the diversity of the local geographic species pool, with specific disturbance factors, superimposed upon these patterns, mainly affecting the dominant species.},

We illustrate a novel approach for quantifying nectar reward structures in complex communities, demonstrating that nectar resource diversity (defined as the variety of nectar volume-concentration combinations available) may be a fundamental factor organising nectarivore communities. In a series of diverse bee and entomophilous flower communities in Israel, our measure of nectar resource diversity alone explains the majority of variation in bee species richness, while other nectar variables (volume, concentration, energy value, and water content) have little predictive value per se. The new measure of nectar resource diversity is highly correlated with floral species richness and particularly with the species richness of annuals, yet it is additive in its effect on bee diversity. We conclude that relying solely upon measurements of mean nectar volume and mean nectar concentration overlooks a key characteristic of community-level reward structure, nectar resource diversity, so that previous studies may have failed to identify an important determinant of flower-visitor community structure.},

  abstract  = {The aims of this paper were to consider the coevolution between bumblebee movement patterns within plants and various properties of the plants such as the spatial distribution of their flowers, and to determine the extent to which the bumblebees and the plants can be considered to be maximally adaptive or optimal. Attention was restricted to plants which have flowers arranged on vertical inflorescences and to the bumblebees which visit these plants.

It was found that the bumblebees tend to commence foraging at the bottom of each infloresence, that they tend to move from one flower to the closest vertically higher flower, that they miss flowers as they move upwards and that they tend to leave each inflorescence before reaching the top. It was also found for the four common plant species considered that nectar abundance per flower decreases with flower height on an inflorescence, that the flowers with receptive stigmas are restricted to the bottoms of the inflorescences while the flowers shedding pollen occur above them, and that the flowers are arranged approximately in spirals on the inflorescences. 

The pattern of movements of the bumblebees and the various properties of the plants appear to represent coevolved adaptations. Furthermore the bumblebees' movement patterns appear to be optimal in the sense that they result in the maximum net rate of energy gain to the bumblebees. Further studies are necessary, however, to determine whether or not the plants can be considered to be optimal. 

An exception to the above scheme is provided by a plant which is quite uncommon in the study area. This plant also has flowers on vertical inflorescences and appears to be pollinated by bumblebees. However, while the pattern of movements of the bumblebees on this plant species are extremely similar to those on the four common species, this plant species exhibits quite different properties from the other four. Two possible explanations for this exception are presented.},

  abstract  = {Beginning with Emlen (1966) and MacArthur and Pianka (1966) and extending through the last ten years, several authors have sought to predict the foraging behavior of animals by means of mathematical models. These models are very similar, in that they all assume that the fitness of a foraging animal is a function of the efficiency of foraging measured in terms of some "currency" (Schoener, 1971) - usually energy - and that natural selection has resulted in animals thatforage so as to maximize this fitness. As a result of these similarities, the models have become known as "optimal foraging models"; and the theory that embodies them, "optimal foraging theory." The situations to which optimalforaging theory has been applied, with the exception of afew recent studies, can be divided into thefollowingfour categories: (1) choice by an animal of whichfood types to eat (i.e., optimal diet); (2) choice of which patch type to feed in (i.e., optimal patch choice); (3) optimal allocation of time to different patches; and (4) optimal patterns and speed of movements. In this review we discuss each of these categories separately, dealing with both the theoretical developments and the data that permit tests of the predictions. The review is selective in the sense that we emphasize studies that either develop testable predictions or that attempt to test such predictions in a precise quantitative manner. We also discuss what we see to be some of the future developments in the area of optimal foraging theory and how this theory can be related to other areas of biology. Our general conclusion is that the simple models so far formulated are supported reasonably well by available data and that we are optimistic about the value both now and in the future of optimal foraging theory. We argue, however, that these simple models will require much modification, especially to deal with situations that either cannot easily be put into one or another of the above four categories or entail currencies more complicated than just energy.},

In this context, selective pressures are likely to favor the presence of floral traits adequate to a variety of pollinators. In this paper, we document the pollination ecology of Encholirium spectabile, focusing on nectar production pattern, and on the frequency, behavior and effectiveness of day- and nighttime pollinators. We have addressed two main questions: (1) Are the flowers traits of E. spectabile favorable to a mixed pollination system? and (2) Do diurnal and nocturnal visitors behave as effective pollinators? Nectar traits of E. spectabile were similar to other chiropterophilous and ornithophilous bromeliads, and the main pollinators were exclusively vertebrates, both nocturnal (bats and opossum), and diurnal (hummingbirds and Passeriformes). Despite E. spectabile is primarily chiropterophilous, its flowers were open during the entire day and night, with continuous nectar production, what is favorable to the occurrence of a mixed pollination system, involving a unique richness of vertebrate as pollinators of a single plant species. This strategy has assured to E. spectabile high frequency of visits along flowering with high reproductive success.},

  abstract  = {The current global pollination crisis highlights the advantages of the provision of pollination services by a suite of core pollinators. Recent declines in honeybee populations have focused attetion on the potential for unmanaged insects to replace them as pollinators of global food crops. The ability of unmanaged pollinators to replace services currently provided by honeybees requires understanding of their efficiency as pollinators as well as the spatial and temporal variability of their services, yet few quantitative assessments currently exist. In order to understand if unmanaged pollinator taxa are capable of providing equivalent polination services to the honeybee I compared the pollination services provided by unmanaged taxa to the honeybee within a Brassica rapa mass flowering crop in a highly modified New Zealand agricultural landscape. First, I examined four functional traits of insect flower visitors in order to compare the pollination services provided: per visit pollen deposition, the probability of stigmatic contact, visitation rate, and capacity to transport pollen over distance. Second, I investigated how these traits vary between unmanaged pollinators and the honeybee both in space (between field locations) and time (within a day and between years) to examine whether unmanaged pollinators are capable of providing consistent, stable pollination services to a B. rapa mass flowering agricultural crop.

I observed a total of 41 managed and unmanaged taxa visiting flowers of B. rapa. In addition to A. mellifera, seven insects species visited flowers frequently. These were three other bees: Lasioglossum sordidum, Bombus terrestris and Leioproctus sp.; and four flies: Dilophus nigrostima, Melanostoma fasciatum, Melangyna novaezelandiae and Eristalis tenax. Two bee species, Bombus terrestris and Leioproctus sp. and one fly, Eristalis tenax were as efficient as the honeybee and as effective (in terms of rate of flower visitation). A higher honeybee abundance however, resulted in it being the more effective pollinator overall. All frequently visiting pollinators were consistent in their visits over a four year period, even though individually visit frequencies varied between taxa. The pooled services of the unmanaged taxa were equal to or better than the honeybee in three of the four years.

Pollinators were active at different times of the day. Most unmanaged fly taxa were most active early in the morning and late in the afternoon/evening. Managed and unmanaged bee taxa and one fly (D. nigrostigma) were more active in the middle of the day. Overall visitation rate did not differ significantly between the hours within a day, indicating that changing taxonomic composition in assemblage structure was not accompanied by changes in potential pollination services. The contributions to visitation rate provided by fly taxa outside of standard survey hours resulted in a higher visitation rate at the end of the day.

Both managed and unmanaged pollinators transported viable pollen outside of a B. rapa crop. These consisted of three species from two bee families (Hymenoptera: Apidae and Halictidae), and seven species from four fly families (Diptera: Bibiondae, Stratiomyidae, Syrphidae and Tachinidae). Pollen viability varied between insect families and declined with distance from the crop but was nonetheless carried to at least 300m outside of the crop.

The results of this study suggest alternative pollinator taxa are capable of performing pollination services in mass flower crop equal to or better than the managed European honeybee. Alternative land management practices that increase the population sizes of unmanaged pollinator taxa to levels resulting in visitation frequencies as high as A. mellifera, have the potential to replace services provided by the honeybee. At the time of this study the Varroa sp. mite had not been recorded in the Canterbury region of New Zealand, where this study was conducted. It has since been recorded in this area, representing a significant possible threat to pollination services and hence crop production. My results have direct application suggesting that pollination services historically provided by managed honeybees might be replaced by those provided by other existing unmanaged pollinator taxa. Evidence from my study suggests that increases in the abundances of these alternative taxa should translate into greater pollination services.

To increase the population sizes of unmanaged pollinator taxa, I suggests ``in-situ" management. This will require a change in land management practices in order to ensure year round refuge, feeding, nesting, and other resource requirements of pollinator taxa are met.},

  abstract  = {Wild and managed bees are well documented as effective pollinators of global crops of economic importance. However, the contributions by pollinators other than bees have been little explored despite their potential to contribute to crop production and stability in the face of environmental change. Non-bee pollinators include flies, beetles, moths, butterflies, wasps, ants, birds, and bats, among others. Here we focus on non-bee insects and synthesize 39 field studies from five continents that directly measured the crop pollination services provided by non-bees, honey bees, and other bees to compare the relative contributions of these taxa. Non-bees performed 25-50% of the total number of flower visits. Although non-bees were less effective pollinators than bees per flower visit, they made more visits; thus these two factors compensated for each other, resulting in pollination services rendered by non-bees that were similar to those provided by bees. In the subset of studies that measured fruit set, fruit set increased with non-bee insect visits independently of bee visitation rates, indicating that non-bee insects provide a unique benefit that is not provided by bees. We also show that non-bee insects are not as reliant as bees on the presence of remnant natural or seminatural habitat in the surrounding landscape. These results strongly suggest that non-bee insect pollinators play a significant role in global crop production and respond differently than bees to landscape structure, probably making their crop pollination services more robust to changes in land use. Non-bee insects provide a valuable service and provide potential insurance against bee population declines.},

  abstract  = {Ecology Letters (2011) 14: 69-74AbstractClimate change has led to phenological shifts in flowering plants and insect pollinators, causing concern that these shifts will disrupt plant-pollinator mutualisms. We experimentally investigated how shifts in flowering onset affect pollinator visitation for 14 native perennial plant species, six of which have exhibited shifts to earlier flowering over the last 70 years and eight of which have not. We manipulated flowering onset in greenhouses and then observed pollinator visitation in the field. Five of six species with historically advanced flowering received more visits when flowering was experimentally advanced, whereas seven of eight species with historically unchanged flowering received fewer visits when flowering earlier. This pattern suggests that species unconstrained by pollinators have advanced their flowering, whereas species constrained by pollinators have not. In contrast to current concern about phenological mismatches disrupting plant-pollinator mutualisms, mismatches at the onset of flowering are not occurring for most of our study species.},

  abstract  = {The areas of wild land around the edges of agricultural fields are a vital resource for many species. These include insect pollinators, to whom field margins provide both nest sites and important resources (especially when adjacent crops are not in flower). Nesting pollinators travel relatively short distances from the nest to forage: most species of bee are known to travel less than two kilometres away. In order to ensure that these pollinators have sufficient areas of wild land within reach of their nests, agricultural landscapes need to be designed to accommodate the limited travelling distances of nesting pollinators. We used a spatially-explicit modelling approach to consider whether increasing the width of wild strips of land within the agricultural landscape will enhance the amount of wild resources available to a nesting pollinator, and if it would impact differently on pollinators with differing foraging strategies. This was done both by creating field structures with a randomised geography, and by using landscape data based upon the British agricultural landscape. These models demonstrate that enhancing field margins should lead to an increase in the availability of forage to pollinators that nest within the landscape. With the exception of species that only forage within a very short range of their nest (less than 125 m), a given amount of field margin manipulation should enhance the proportion of land available to a pollinator for foraging regardless of the distance over which it normally travels to find food. A fixed amount of field edge manipulation should therefore be equally beneficial for both longer-distance nesting foragers such as honeybees, and short-distance foragers such as solitary bees.},

In random environments there are no spatial autocorrelation at all, while in fine-grained systems positive autocorrelations flip to negative ones and back again against distance. With increasing grain size the turnover rate of spatial autocorrelation slows down. Using a cellular automaton with foragers having limited information about their feeding environment we examined how well consumer numbers matched resource availability, also known as the ideal free distribution. The match is the better the smaller the size of the environmental grain. This is somewhat contrary to the observation that in large-grained environments the spatial autocorrelation is high and positive over long distances. In such an environment foragers, by knowing a limited surrounding, should in fact know a much larger area because of the spatially autocorrelated resource pattern. Yet, when foragers have limited knowledge, we observed that the degree of undermatching (i.e., more individuals in less productive patches than expected) increases with increasing grain size.},

Certain cropping systems, however, provide enormous foraging resources, and are beneficial for population build up of native bees,
especially eusocial bees such as bumble bees. In this review, we present evidence of a flourishing bumble bee fauna in the Willamette
Valley in western Oregon which we believe is sustained by cultivation of bee-pollinated crops which bloom in sequence, and in
synchrony with foraging by queens and workers of a complex of bumble bee species. In support of our perspective, we describe the
Oregon landscape and ascribe the large bumble bee populations to the presence of a pollen source in spring (cultivated blueberries)
followed by one in summer (red clover seed crops). Based on our studies, we recommend integration into conservation approaches
of multiple agroecosystems that bloom in sequence for sustaining and building bumble bee populations.},

  abstract  = {Foraging behaviors of bumble bee workers have been examined in natural habitats, whereas agricultural landscapes, which can provide insights on flight distances to fragmented patches of bloom, have received limited attention. In particular, information on worker flight distances to crops blooming several months after nests have been established is invaluable. Here, we examined foraging patterns of Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski in late-season blooming clover in the agriculturaldominated Willamette Valley in Oregon. Workers from 10 fields collected over 2 yr were assigned to full sibling families (colonies) by using eight microsatellite loci. With estimation of numbers of unseen species, we inferred the presence of 189 colonies from 433 bees genotyped in year 1, and 144 from 296 genotyped the next year. Worker foraging distance was estimated to be at least 11.6 km, half the distance between the most remote fields visited by the same colonies. Numbers of nests contributing workers to each field ranged from 15 to 163. Overall, 165 (50%) colonies foraged in two or more fields, and thus used common resources within the landscape. Estimates of average nest densities in the landscape each year ranged from 0.76/km2 to 22.16/km2, and highlighted the influences of various study parameters incorporated into the calculation including sample size, distances between sites, and analytical tools used to estimate unsampled individuals. Based on the results, bumble bees can fly long distances, and this could facilitate their survival in fragmented agricultural landscapes. This has important implications for the scale of habitat management in bumble bee conservation programs.},

  abstract  = {Animals sometimes forage for resources whose benefits are not energy-based. In such cases, the benefits and costs of foraging cannot be directly compared, making it difficult to evaluate the currency of fitness maximized by the animal's behaviour. For bees, pollen represents such a resource, because they collect pollen as the sole protein source for developing larvae, rather than as a source of energy. This study compared three currencies that could be maximized during pollen collection by bumblebees (Bombus s) foraging on different lupin species (Lupinus s): pollen collected per inflorescence, pollen collection rate (gross benefits/time) and pollen collection efficiency (gross benefits/costs). Bees visiting lupin inflorescences begin foraging low on an inflorescence and then move upward through a gradient of increasing pollen availability. To maximize each currency, we predicted that a bee would begin foraging at a different position along a lupin inflorescence, depending on the relative influences of the time and energy costs associated with handling flowers and flight. Based on comparisons of observed and predicted starting positions for seven situations, maximization of gross pollen-collection efficiency predicted observed behaviour better than either pollen collected per inflorescence or gross rate of pollen collection. Such maximization of pollen-collection efficiency would enhance a bee's lifetime input of pollen to her colony, as has been demonstrated for nectar-collecting bees. Hence, the economics of foraging for non-energetic resources do not differ qualitatively from foraging for energy.},

In this paper, we explore the effects of crab spiders (Araneae: Thomisidae) on the behavior of 2 species of bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) foraging for nectar and pollen on 3 different plant species in central Portugal. In 2 experiments, we found that the eusocial bee Apis mellifera was significantly less likely to inspect and accept a flower or inflorescence if it harbored a spider. In contrast, we found no such effects of spiders on the behavior of the solitary bee Eucera notata. Further experiments showed that the effects of environmental cues associated with predators on flower visitation by A. mellifera were detectable even when no spider was present at the moment a flower was encountered. Such indirect effects were only identified, however, in bees foraging on 1 of 2 plant species studied. In a final experiment, A. mellifera was shown to respond negatively to the presence of the corpses of conspecifics glued to flowers. This suggests that prey corpses left exposed on petals or bracts by spiders provide an obvious cue that bees can use to avoid predators. These results add to a growing body of evidence that plant-pollinator interactions are not immune to the effects of predation and suggest that the strength of such effects vary both between and within species.},

We extend a model of ideally motivated populations to describe the local and regional consequences of interactions between three populations distinguished by their levels of cooperation and exploitation. Inspired by the classic prisoner{\textquoteright}s dilemma game, stereotypical fitness functions describe a baseline non-cooperative population whose per capita fitness decreases with density, obligate co-operators who initially benefit from the presence of conspecifics, and kleptoparasites who require heterospecifics to extract resources from the environment. We examine these populations in multiple combinations, determine where both local and regional coexistence is permitted, and investigate conditions under which one population will invade another. When they invade co-operators in resource-rich areas, kleptoparasites initiate a dynamic instability that leads to the loss of both populations; however, selfish hosts, who can persist at low densities, are immune to this risk. Furthermore, adaptive movement may delay the onset of instability as dispersal relieves dynamic stress. Selfish and cooperative populations default to mutual exclusion, but asymmetric variations in interference strength may relax this condition and permit limited sympatry within the environment. Distinct sub-communities characterize the overall spatial structure.},

Some components of species richness and composition of this contemporary assemblage were compared with those of a historical (pre-1965) assemblage, and the contribution of the three collecting methods used in the 2007 survey protocol was evaluated. Estimates of species richness indicated that Malaise traps yielded more species than did pan traps or sweep netting, and that species composition did not differ significantly between Malaise trap and pan trap catches. These results suggest that Malaise traps and sweep netting are adequate methods to survey northern Muscidae. We report little difference in estimated species richness and composition between time periods for material collected by sweep netting. When all material from the 2007 survey was pooled, 87% of the pre-1965 species were collected again in 2007. Most nonoverlapping species between time periods were rare in samples and (or) collected by different methods, suggesting a failure to detect as the most likely explanation for their absence in one assemblage. Nevertheless, the proportion of aquatic and semiaquatic species of Spilogona Schnabl was more than twice as high in the list of species not recovered in 2007 than in the pre-1965 assemblage.},

While bee floral food resources have been drastically reduced over past decades in human-dominated landscapes, no field study has yet been undertaken to determine whether there is a carry-over effect between seasonal disruption in floral resource availability and high colony losses.
2.We investigated if a decline in the harvest of pollen by honeybees in spring affected managed honeybee colony dynamics (brood size, adult population and honey reserves) and health (Varroa mite loads and colony survival) throughout the beekeeping season.
3.A decline in pollen harvest was associated with a direct reduction in brood production, leading to a negative effect on the adult population size later in the season, and lower honey reserves before the onset of winter. Furthermore, the decline in pollen harvest negatively impacted the health of the colony, resulting in higher Varroa mite loads and higher seasonal and winter colony losses.
4.Early warning signs of these carry-over effects were identified, showing that preferential investment in honey reserves instead of brood production early in the season increased the decline in pollen harvest and its associated carry-over effects.
5.Synthesis and applications. The results suggest that the decline in pollen harvest may have been overlooked as a cause of pollen shortage and associated bee colony losses. Strategies to avoid such losses in intensive farmland systems include i) limiting or avoiding honey harvests in spring, ii) monitoring colonies for early warning signals of colony failure, and iii) increasing the amount of floral resources available through wise land-use management.},

The reduction of semi-natural habitats is also suspected to entail floral resource scarcity for bees. Yet, the seasonal dynamics and composition of the honey bee diet remains poorly documented to date. In this study, we studied the seasonal contribution of mass-flowering crops (rapeseed and sunflower) vs. other floral resources, as well as the influence of nutritional quality and landscape composition on pollen diet composition over five consecutive years. From April to October, the mass of pollen and nectar collected by honey bees followed a bimodal seasonal trend, marked by a two-month period of low food supply between the two oilseed crop mass-flowerings (ending in May for rapeseed and July for sunflower). Bees collected nectar mainly from crops while pollen came from a wide diversity of herbaceous and woody plant species in semi-natural habitats or from weeds in crops. Weed species constituted the bulk of the honey bee diet between the mass flowering crop periods (up to 40%) and are therefore suspected to play a critical role at this time period. The pollen diet composition was related to the nutritional value of the collected pollen and by the local landscape composition. Our study highlights (1) a food supply depletion period of both pollen and nectar resources during late spring, contemporaneously with the demographic peak of honey bee populations, (2) a high botanical richness of pollen diet, mostly proceeding from trees and weeds, and (3) a pollen diet composition influenced by the local landscape composition. Our results therefore support the Agri-Environmental Schemes intended to promote honey bees and beekeeping sustainability through the enhancement of flower availability in agricultural landscapes.},

  abstract  = {Over recent years there has been an accumulation of evidence from a variety of experimental, theoretical, and field studies that many organisms use a movement strategy approximated by Lévy flights when they are searching for resources. Lévy flights are random movements that can maximize the efficiency of resource searches in uncertain environments. This is a highly significant finding because it suggests that Lévy flights provide a rigorous mathematical basis for separating out evolved, innate behaviors from environmental influences. We discuss recent developments in random-search theory, as well as the many different experimental and data collection initiatives that have investigated search strategies. Methods for trajectory construction and robust data analysis procedures are presented. The key to prediction and understanding does, however, lie in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying the observed patterns. We discuss candidate neurological, olfactory, and learning mechanisms for the emergence of Lévy flight patterns in some organisms, and note that convergence of behaviors along such different evolutionary pathways is not surprising given the energetic efficiencies that Lévy flight movement patterns confer.},

We show that the flight patterns have a scale-free (L{\'e}vy-flight) characteristic that constitutes an optimal searching strategy for the location of the feeder. It is shown that this searching strategy would remain optimal even if the implementation of the L{\'e}vy-flights was imprecise due, for example, to errors in the bees{\textquoteright} path integration system or difficulties in responding to variable wind conditions.

This study investigates the role that inbreeding depression plays in newly colonized populations of a common, dioecious, weedy species, Silene alba. Experimental greenhouse studies presented here show that S. alba displays high levels of inbreeding depression (expressed as lowered germination success) in progeny produced with inbreeding coefficients of 0.125 (half-sib mated), 0.250 (full-sib mated), and 0.375 (second-generation sib mated). In addition, it is shown that the degree of inbreeding depression in 12 natural colonies varies with the degree of isolation from other established populations. Significantly, data from experimental populations showed that gene flow into patches comprised of full sibs was higher than those observed into patches comprised of unrelated individuals and may serve to mitigate the effects of inbreeding depression. It is suggested that population connectivity through pollen-mediated gene flow may have substantial effects on the persistence of isolated colonies and on the spatial structure of a metapopulation in general.},

  abstract  = {Patterns of demographic and social variation exhibited by the sweat bee Halictus ligatus, reveal that the expression of eusocial colony organization is associated with local environmental conditions, harsher conditions promoting more classical eusociality and gentler conditions promoting diminished eusociality. We examined a variety of factors affecting body size variation of H. ligatus at a nesting aggregation near Victoria in southern Ontario, Canada during the summers of 1984, 1990, and 1991. Body size variation was associated with gender and reproductive caste as expected, and there were significant colony effects on size as well. An unexpected result was the dramatic effect of local environmental conditions on body size. Changes in weather patterns from year to year resulted in significant body size variation among all classes of adult sweat bees, including queens, workers, gynes, and males. In 1990 cool, rainy weather led to the production of brood with relatively small body sizes, while in 1984 and 1991, relatively dry, warm weather had the opposite effect. Weather probably influenced brood body size by affecting the ability of adult female bees to gather provisions for the larvae, and so indirectly affecting food availability to brood. Since queens are produced a year before their own workers, environmental factors affecting their relative body sizes are uncorrelated. Nevertheless, the degree of eusocial colony organization is strongly affected by variation in the relative sizes of queens and workers, and this illustrates the extent to which stochastic environmental variation structures opportunities for behavioural interactions in primitively eusocial bees. The pattern of inverse variation between temperature and body size in this bee contradicts the general pattern of increased body size at higher temperatures generally seen in insects and other ectotherms, and indicates that social insects could be an exception to this rule.},

  abstract  = {* 1The ability to identify key ecological processes is important when solving applied problems. Increasingly, ecologists are adopting Akaike's information criterion (AIC) as a metric to help them assess and select among multiple process-based ecological models. Surprisingly, however, it is still unclear how best to incorporate AIC into the selection process in order to address the trade-off between maximizing the probability of retaining the most parsimonious model while minimizing the number of models retained.
* 2Ecological count data are often observed to be overdispersed with respect to best-fitting models. Overdispersion is problematic when performing an AIC analysis, as it can result in selection of overly complex models which can lead to poor ecological inference. This paper describes and illustrates two approaches that deal effectively with overdispersion. The first approach involves modelling the causes of overdispersion implicitly using compound probability distributions. The second approach ignores the causes of overdispersion and uses quasi-AIC (QAIC) as a metric for model parsimony.
* 3Simulations and a novel method that identifies the most parsimonious model are used to demonstrate the utility of the two overdispersion approaches within the context of two ecological examples. The first example addresses binomial data obtained from a study of fish survival (as related to habitat structure) and the second example addresses Poisson data obtained from a study of flower visitation by nectarivores.
* 4Applying either overdispersion approach reduces the chance of selecting overly complex models, and both approaches result in very similar ecological inference. In addition, inference can be made more reliable by incorporating model nesting into the selection process (i.e. identifying which models are special cases of others), as it reduces the number of models selected without significantly reducing the probability of retaining the most parsimonious models.
* 5Synthesis and applications. When data are overdispersed, inference can be improved by either modelling the causes of overdispersion or applying QAIC as a metric for model parsimony. Inference can also be improved by adopting a model filtering procedure based on how models are nested. The general simulation approach presented in this paper for identifying the most parsimonious model, as defined by information theory, should help to improve our understanding of the reliability of model selection when using AIC, and help the development of better selection rules.},

  abstract  = {Behavioural ecologists often study complex systems in which multiple hypotheses could be proposed to explain observed phenomena. For some systems, simple controlled experiments can be employed to reveal part of the complexity; often, however, observational studies that incorporate a multitude of causal factors may be the only (or preferred) avenue of study. We assess the value of recently advocated approaches to inference in both contexts.Specifically, we examine the use of information theoretic (IT) model selection using Akaike's information criterion (AIC). We find that, for simple analyses, the advantages of switching to an IT-AIC approach are likely to be slight, especially given recent emphasis on biological rather than statistical significance. By contrast, the model selection approach embodied by IT approaches offers significant advantages when applied to problems of more complex causality. Model averaging is an intuitively appealing extension to model selection. However, we were unable to demonstrate consistent improvements in prediction accuracy when using model averaging with IT-AIC; our equivocal results suggest that more research is needed on its utility. We illustrate our arguments with worked examples from behavioural experiments.},

A forager's perception of resource profitability may be affected by her past foraging experience. To test this, the concentrations of sucrose solutions in feeders were varied and dance characteristics that serve as indicators of resource profitability were recorded. Round dances of foragers that had last visited a lesser concentration than that on which they were presently foraging had higher rates of directional reversal, circuit rates and speeds than those of foragers on the same concentration that had last visited a feeder offering a higher sucrose concentration. Dance information related to resource profitability was thus modulated by the immediate past experience of a forager, and was not based strictly on absolute resource profitability. Losses were weighted more heavily than gains. Contrary to the assumptions of current models of optimal prey choice, past foraging experience can influence resource assessment.},

Patch isolation, a crucial parameter to the predictions of island biogeography and metapopulation theories, is measured by distance alone. To test whether the type of interpatch matrix can contribute significantly to patch isolation, I conducted a mark-recapture study on a butterfly community inhabiting meadows in a naturally patchy landscape. I used maximum likelihood to estimate the relative resistances of the two major matrix types (willow thicket and conifer forest) to butterfly movement between meadow patches. For four of the six butterfly taxa (subfamilies or tribes) studied, conifer was 3-12 times more resistant than willow. For the two remaining taxa (the most vagile and least vagile in the community), resistance estimates for willow and conifer were not significantly different, indicating that responses to matrix differ even among closely related species. These results suggest that the surrounding matrix can significantly influence the “effective isolation” of habitat patches, rendering them more or less isolated than simple distance or classic models would indicate. Modification of the matrix may provide opportunities for reducing patch isolation and thus the extinction risk of populations in fragmented landscapes.},

  abstract  = {Pollination by bees and other animals increases the size, quality, or stability of harvests for 70% of leading global crops. Because native species pollinate many of these crops effectively, conserving habitats for wild pollinators within agricultural landscapes can help maintain pollination services. Using hierarchical Bayesian techniques, we synthesize the results of 23 studies - representing 16 crops on five continents - to estimate the general relationship between pollination services and distance from natural or semi-natural habitats. We find strong exponential declines in both pollinator richness and native visitation rate. Visitation rate declines more steeply, dropping to half of its maximum at 0.6 km from natural habitat, compared to 1.5 km for richness. Evidence of general decline in fruit and seed set - variables that directly affect yields - is less clear. Visitation rate drops more steeply in tropical compared with temperate regions, and slightly more steeply for social compared with solitary bees. Tropical crops pollinated primarily by social bees may therefore be most susceptible to pollination failure from habitat loss. Quantifying these general relationships can help predict consequences of land use change on pollinator communities and crop productivity, and can inform landscape conservation efforts that balance the needs of native species and people.},

  abstract  = {Mass-flowering crops may affect long-term population dynamics, but effects on pollinators have never been studied across several years. We monitored wild bees in oilseed rape fields in 16 landscapes in Germany in two consecutive years. Effects on bee densities of landscape oilseed rape cover in the years of monitoring and in the previous years were evaluated with landscape data from three consecutive years. We fit empirical data to a mechanistic model to provide estimates for oilseed rape attractiveness and its effect on bee productivity in comparison to the rest of the landscape, and we evaluated consequences for pollinator densities in consecutive years. Our results show that high oilseed rape cover in the previous year enhances current densities of wild bees (except for bumble bees). Moreover, we show a strong attractiveness of and dilution on (i.e., decreasing bee densities with increasing landscape oilseed rape cover) oilseed rape for bees during flowering in the current year, modifying the effect of the previous year's oilseed rape cover in the case of wild bees (excluding Bombus). As long as other factors such as nesting sites or natural enemies do not limit bee reproduction, our findings suggest long-term positive effects of mass-flowering crops on bee populations, at least for non-Bombus generalists, which possibly help to maintain crop pollination services even when crop area increases. Similar effects are conceivable for other organisms providing ecosystem services in annual crops and should be considered in future studies.},

  abstract  = {Previous studies focused mainly on the provision of ecosystem services by species movements between semi-natural and managed habitats, whereas data on spillover effects between two managed habitats or between habitats that provide target resources in non-overlapping time periods are lacking. We studied densities of three pollinator groups on sunflower fields as a late mass-flowering crop in 16 landscapes that differed in the relative cover of oilseed rape as an early mass-flowering crop, in the relative cover of sunflowers and in the relative cover of semi-natural habitats. Our aim was to evaluate dynamics between two crops with non-overlapping flowering periods. Densities of bumble bees in lateflowering sunflower fields were enhanced by earlyflowering oil-seed rape. Highest bumble bee densities in the late-flowering crop were reached in landscapes that combined high relative covers of oil-seed rape and semi-natural habitats. Further, low relative covers of oil-seed rape in spring led to decreased bumble bee densities in late-flowering sunflower fields in landscapes with high relative covers of sunflower fields (dilution effect), whereas in landscapes with high relative covers of oil-seed rape, no dilution of bumble bees was found. Thus, our results indicate that early mass-flowering crops can mitigate pollinator dilution in crops flowering later in the season. We conclude that the management of landscape-scale patterns of early and late mass-flowering crops together with semi-natural habitats could be used to ensure crop pollination services. Similar processes could also apply for other species groups and may be an important, but so far disregarded, determinant of population densities in agroecosystems.},

This claim is based on reports that (1) levels of intraspecific gene flow may be too low to account for species' integration, and (2) populations are likely to diverge rather than evolve in parallel when exposed to uniform selection pressures. These conclusions are prematur. A review of the plant literature reveals that there is sufficient gene flow to enable the efficient spread of strongly favourable alleles (s > 0.05), the most likely agents of collective evolution. Moreover, estimates of s for major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are sufficiently large to enable their spread across the range of a species, although minor QTLs seem more likely to evolve locally. In addition, evidence that intraspecific variation in genetic background affects the response of alleles to selection is rare, but examples of parallel genotypic evolution are becoming increasingly common. We conclude that, as traditionally believed, species are the most inclusive entities that directly participate in evolutionary processes. However, we also note that the traditional role of gene flow as a force that constrains differentiation due to genetic drift or local adaptation has been over-emphasised relative to its creative role as a mechanism for the spread of advantageous mutations.},

  abstract  = {The survival of insects that inhabit Canadian {Arctic} regions depends on a number of factors which have important ecological, behavioral, physiological, and biochemical components. The ability to withstand low winter temperatures is one of the most conspicuous adaptations of northern insects and the one most closely studied in the laboratory. Most species studied so far conform to one or other of the two major overwintering strategies, namely, frost susceptibility, the ability to avoid freezing by supercooling to a considerable degree, or frost tolerance, the survival of actual ice formation within the body. The Arctic beetle, Pytho americanus Kirby, is frost tolerant in both larval and adult stages, a situation which would be congruous with its northern distribution and allow it to spread its life cycle over a number of growing seasons. The main biochemical correlates during the cold-hardening process in this species are increasing glycerol and decreasing glycogen concentrations. In addition to its normally assumed roles in cryoprotection there is evidence to suggest that glycerol may further serve to minimize dehydration in the overwintering insect by increasing the level of bound water. P. americanus larvae and adults have narrow supercooling ranges and maintain their supercooling points in the region of -4 to -8 $^\circ$C. It is hypothesized that these elevated supercooling points are a result of the presence in the hemolymph of nucleating agents which ensure ice formation at high subzero temperatures.

Low temperature tolerance strategies of some other {Arctic} and {Alpine} species have been examined and compared with those of relatives from more southerly latitudes. P. americanus has been collected in the Canadian Rockies at elevations of over 6000', and its frost-tolerant attributes are identical to those of the population collected in the Arctic. A closely related species, P. deplanatus, from the Rockies, however, although it too exhibits frost tolerance in the larval stage, differs markedly from P. americanus in its ability to depress its supercooling range to -54$^\circ$C. It appears that P. deplanatus does not have the ability to synthesize ice-nucleating agents and, therefore, can overwinter in a supercooled condition. Two congeneric species of willow leaf gall sawflies (Pontania s), one from Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T., and the other from southern Vancouver Island have also been compared and contrasted. Pontania sp. on Salix glauca (Tuk., ca. 70 $^\circ$N) is frost tolerant in its larval stage, has relatively high supercooling points (ca. -9.0$^\circ$C), but does not accumulate glycerol. Pontania sp. from Salix lasiandra (Victoria, ca. 48 °N) has almost identical overwintering properties, indicating the close phylogenetic affinities of cold tolerance in this genus rather than independent adaptation to widely different climatic conditions. Some of the lowest supercooling points ever recorded are from willow stem gall forming insects. Rhabdophaga sp. (Cecidomyiidae) forms potato galls on the stems of Salix lanata in the Inuvik area, N.W.T. After low temperature acclimation, supercooling points down to -66 $^\circ$C have been recorded from individual larvae. This is a record, and it indicates that we may be dealing with a system in which most water is in a metabolically bound state. Glycerol levels reach 20\% of the fresh body weight during this period. Diastrophus kincaidii Cynipidae) forms stem galls on Thimble Berry (Rubus parviflorus) on southern Vancouver Island. Both of the forementioned species overwinter as larvae in their galls and are, therefore, exposed to ambient air temperatures. A more benign winter climate on Vancouver Island is reflected in the fact that D. kincaidii has supercooling points only in the -30 to -33 $^\circ$C range at the peak of low temperature acclimation, and glycerol levels just below 4\% of fresh body weight. Both species are frost susceptible and depend on their supercooling abilities to survive low winter temperatures.},

  abstract  = {* 1Agriculture represents the dominant land use throughout much of western Europe, and a significant part of European biodiversity is associated with this habitat. We attempted to quantify the changes in agriculture and biodiversity in Britain since the 1940s.
* 2There have been widespread declines in the populations of many groups of organisms associated with farmland in Britain and north-west Europe. The declines have been particularly marked amongst habitat specialists; many of the taxa still common on farmland are habitat generalists.
* 3Farming practices have become increasingly intensive in the post-war period, with a dramatic reduction in landscape diversity. Since 1945, there has been a 65% decline in the number of farms, a 77% decline in farm labour and an almost fourfold increase in yield. Farms have become more specialized; the greatly increased use of machinery has made operations quicker and more efficient, but has resulted in the removal of 50% of the hedgerow stock. Autumn sowing of crops has become predominant, with winter stubbles now far less prevalent. The number and extent of chemical applications has increased greatly, but the net amount applied, and their persistence, has decreased in recent years.
* 4Intensification has had a wide range of impacts on biodiversity, but data for many taxa are too scarce to permit a detailed assessment of the factors involved. Reduction in habitat diversity was important in the 1950s and 1960s; reduction in habitat quality is probably more important now.
* 5As a case study, the declines in populations of seed-eating birds populations were assessed in relation to changing agricultural management. Generally, the declines were likely to be caused by a reduced food supply in the non-breeding season, although other factors may be important for particular species.
* 6Agriculture will face a number of challenges in the medium term. While research into the mechanisms underlying species and habitat associations, and their interaction with scale, will be critical in under-pinning management, consideration of farmer attitudes and socio-economic factors is likely to be as important. Biodiversity may benefit from integrated farming techniques but these need to incorporate environmental objectives explicitly, rather than as a fringe benefit.},

As the high arctic is predicted to be one of the most strongly affected biogeoclimatic zones in the next 50 years, understanding these interactions is important in determining ecosystem responses to climate change. Observations took place in July 2010, at Alexandra Fiord, Nunavut, Canada, and consisted of direct observation of plots of flowering Salix arctica, Dryas integrifolia, and Papaver radicatum. Visiting insects were categorized into families, and visitation was compared between species of plants. Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) and Butterflies and Moths (Lepidoptera) were found to play a minor role in pollination, while flies (Dipterans) were shown to be the major pollinators. Of the Dipterans observed, the Syrphidae tended to be generalist pollinators (visiting all flower species equally), while Muscidae tended to visit Papaver radicatum. This may be due to Muscidae undergoing thermoregulation by basking in the corolla, while Syrphidae focus more on nectar gathering from Dryas integrifolia and Salix arctica.},

  abstract  = {The pressures on honeybee (Apis mellifera) populations, resulting from threats by modern pesticides, parasites, predators and diseases, have raised awareness of the economic importance and critical role this insect plays in agricultural societies across the globe. However, the association of humans with A. mellifera predates post-industrial-revolution agriculture, as evidenced by the widespread presence of ancient Egyptian bee iconography dating to the Old Kingdom (approximately 2400 bc)1. There are also indications of Stone Age people harvesting bee products; for example, honey hunting is interpreted from rock art2 in a prehistoric Holocene context and a beeswax find in a pre-agriculturalist site3. However, when and where the regular association of A. mellifera with agriculturalists emerged is unknown4. One of the major products of A. mellifera is beeswax, which is composed of a complex suite of lipids including n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids and fatty acyl wax esters. The composition is highly constant as it is determined genetically through the insect’s biochemistry. Thus, the chemical ‘fingerprint’ of beeswax provides a reliable basis for detecting this commodity in organic residues preserved at archaeological sites, which we now use to trace the exploitation by humans of A. mellifera temporally and spatially. Here we present secure identifications of beeswax in lipid residues preserved in pottery vessels of Neolithic Old World farmers. The geographical range of bee product exploitation is traced in Neolithic Europe, the Near East and North Africa, providing the palaeoecological range of honeybees during prehistory. Temporally, we demonstrate that bee products were exploited continuously, and probably extensively in some regions, at least from the seventh millennium cal bc, likely fulfilling a variety of technological and cultural functions. The close association of A. mellifera with Neolithic farming communities dates to the early onset of agriculture and may provide evidence for the beginnings of a domestication process.},

  abstract  = {Several bee species are experiencing significant population declines. As bees exclusively rely on pollen for development and survival, such declines could be partly related to changes in their host-plant abundance and quality. Here we investigate whether generalist bumble bee species, with stable population trends over the past years, adapted their diets in response to changes in the distribution and chemical quality of their pollen resources. We selected five common species of bumble bee in NW Europe for which we had a precise description of their pollen diet through two time periods ("prior to1950" and "2004-2005"). For each species we assessed if the shift in their pollen diet was related with the changes in the suitable area of their pollen resources. Concurrently we evaluated whether the chemical composition of pollen resources changed over time and experimentally tested the impact of new major pollen species on the development of B. terrestris micro-colonies.Only one species (i.e. B. lapidarius) significantly included more pollen from resources whose suitable area expanded. This opportunist pattern could partly explain the expansion of B. lapidarius in Europe. Regarding the temporal variation in the chemical composition of the pollen diet, total and essential amino acid contents did not differ significantly between the two time periods while we found significant differences among plant species. This result is driven by the great diversity of resources used by bumble bee species in both periods. Our bioassay revealed that the shift to new major pollen resources allowed micro-colonies to develop, bringing new evidence on the opportunist feature of bumble bee in their diets. Overall the present study shows that the response to pollen resource drift varies among closely related pollinators, and a species-rich plant community ensures generalist species to select a nutrient-rich pollen diet.This article is protected by copyright.

  abstract  = {Bees provide an essential pollination service for crops and wild plants. However, substantial declines in bee populations and diversity have been observed in Europe and North America for the past 50 years, partly due to the loss of natural habitats and reduction of plant diversity resulting from agricultural intensification. To mitigate the negative effects of agricultural intensification, agri-environmental schemes (AES) have been proposed to sustain bees and others pollinators in agrosystems. AES include the preservation of semi-natural habitats such as grasslands, fallows, woodlots, hedgerows or set-aside field margins. However, empirical evidence suggest that the use of those semi-natural habitats by bees may vary greatly among bee functional groups and may further be influenced by the presence of alternative foraging habitats such as mass-flowering crops. The present study sets out to investigate whether the three bee groups typically targeted by AES (honey bees, bumble bees and other wild bees) differ in the way they use those semi-natural habitats relative to common mass-flowering crops (oilseed rape, sunflower, alfalfa) in an intensive agricultural farming system. A clear segregation pattern in the use of floral resources appeared between honey bees and wild bees, with the former being tightly associated with mass-flowering crops and the latter with semi-natural habitats. Bumble bees had an intermediate strategy and behaved as habitat generalists. Therefore, it would be sensible to treat the three bee groups with distinct AES management strategies, and to further consider potential effects on AES efficiency of alternative foraging habitats in the surrounding. This study also stresses the importance of native floral resources, particularly in semi-natural herbaceous habitats, for sustaining wild bee populations.},

  abstract  = {<p>Flower-visiting animals are constantly under predation risk when foraging and hence might be expected to evolve behavioural adaptations to avoid predators. We reviewed the available published and unpublished data to assess the overall effects of predators on pollinator behaviour and to examine sources of variation in these effects. The results of our meta-analysis showed that predation risk significantly decreased flower visitation rates (by 36%) and time spent on flowers (by 51%) by pollinators. The strength of the predator effects depended neither on predator taxa and foraging mode (sit-and-wait or active hunters) nor on pollinator lifestyle (social vs. solitary). However, predator effects differed among pollinator taxa: predator presence reduced flower visitation rates and time spent on flowers by Squamata, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera, but not by Diptera. Furthermore, larger pollinators showed weaker responses to predation risk, probably because they are more difficult to capture. Presence of live crab spiders on flowers had weaker effects on pollinator behaviour than presence of dead or artificial crab spiders or other objects (e.g. dead bees, spheres), suggesting that predator crypsis may be effective to some extent. These results add to a growing consensus on the importance of considering both predator and pollinator characteristics from a community perspective.</p>},

  abstract  = {Characterizing insect pollen carriage between closely related plant species is especially challenging where source species possess morphologically identical pollen and share many pollinators in common. Here, we use an SNP-based assay using the plant \{DNA\} barcoding locus matK to characterize pollen carriage between cultivated Brassica napus and wild Brassica rapa in three sites across southern England. The assay differentiated B. napus and B. rapa pollen carried by honey bees (Apis melifera), bumblebees (Bombus spp.), mining bees (Andrena spp.) and hoverflies (Syrphidae) captured on B. napus plants 1–2 m from wild B. rapa, and on B. rapa plants at various distances from the crop . Apis individuals foraging on B. rapa and carrying B. napus pollen were rarely found beyond 10 m from the crop. However, Bombus and Andrena individuals captured on B. rapa occasionally carried crop pollen up to 300 m from the source field. Hoverflies carried less pollen overall but featured high proportions of B. napus pollen even at the most distant capture points. We predict that different pollinator species will evoke markedly different patterns of interspecific hybrid formation. We conclude that more exhaustive surveys of this kind will help parameterize future mechanistic models to predict the distribution of hybrids between Genetically Modified B. napus and B. rapa on a landscape scale.},

  abstract  = {Brassica napus Linnaeus is considered a self-compatible crop; however, studies show that bee foraging elevates their seed production. Considering bee food shortages during the winter season and that the canola is a winter crop, this study aimed to evaluate the foraging behaviour of Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758 regarding those flowers, and to verify if it presents adequate behaviour for successfully pollinating this crop in Rio Grande do Sul State. The study was carried out in a canola field, in Southern Brazil. The anthesis stages were morphologically characterised and then related to stigma receptivity and pollen grain viability. Similarly, the behaviour of A. mellifera individuals on flowers was followed, considering the number of flowers visited per plant, the amount of time spent on the flowers, touched structures, and collected resources. Floral fidelity was inferred by analysing the pollen load of bees collected on flowers. The bees visited from 1-7 flowers/plant (x = 2.02; sd = 1.16), the time spent on the flowers varied between 1-43 seconds (x = 3.29; sd = 2.36) and, when seeking nectar and pollen, they invariably touched anthers and stigmas. The pollen load presented 100% of B. napus pollen. The bees’ attendance to a small number of flowers/plants, their short permanence on flowers, their contact with anthers and stigma and the integral floral constancy allows their consideration as potential B. napus pollinators.},

were made between plants visited by insects, manually pollinated plants (geitonogamy and xenogamy) and
plants without pollination induction. Pod set and seed production per plant were determined for each treatment.
Among the 8,624 recorded flower-visiting insects, Hymenoptera representatives were the most prevalent
(92.3%), among which 99.8% were A. mellifera. The correlation between these bees and blooming progression
was positive (r = 0.87; p = 0.002). Pollination induction increased seed productivity from 28.4% (autogamy)

  abstract  = {Analyses of habitat use for individuals occupying discrete home ranges are typically based on comparison with null models that implicitly assume no spatial context for habitat use within the home range. For species that regularly return to a central place, a more appropriate null model for estimation of habitat selection may be that of a declining expectation of resource use with distance from the central place, such as a nest site. When this null expectation is ignored and a uniform-use expectation is used for central-place foragers, we predicted (1) positive bias of selection for habitat types near the central place, and (2) bias will increase with the degree to which habitat types are spatially correlated to the central place. We explored these predictions with simulated data, using a range of selection intensities and spatial correlations. Results from the simulations confirmed our predictions: biases were large and positive for those habitat types proximal to the central place. To correct for these biases, we included distance from the central place as an explanatory variable in habitat selection models of simulated central-place foraging, and we found that including distance as a linear factor successfully reduced these biases. We then applied these models to field data from northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) and red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis). For both species, distancebased models performed better than the nonspatial (uniform) model: the models were both statistically superior and produced results more in concordance with our biological understandings. Estimates of selection for habitat types that were disproportionately located near the central place were lower in the distance-based models than in the uniform model, corroborating the results from the simulations. The simple distance-based models we used provide a reasonable means to estimate foraging habitat selection for animals for which a central place can be identified.},

An instantaneous, deterministic theory using graps of the properties of difficult and even unknown autonomous nonlinear differential equation systems has been developed to simplify greatly the task of understanding the dynamics of such systems and of predicting qualitative properties of their solutions. This review shows how the theory may be used to account for some of the observed dynamics of well-known laboratory sistems including their oscillatory periods and neighborhood stability. It also extends the theory to cover situations where the predator prefers to attack weak or otherwise vulnerable victims, In this case, an upper limit is shown to be added to victim oscillations which can serve to promote the survival probability of the system despite the fact that it may diminish the system's ability to return to a steady state following perturbation. Finally, the theory is applied to the problem of management of a pest by biocides. An important result of earlier predation theory, which has tended to be discarded because of the oversiplifications in that work, is shown to hold in many of the more realistic situations described by graphical exploitation theory: addition of a biocide can actually increase the average population densities of the species one intended to attack. The principle at work here may well account for some modern instances of crop-pest population explosions, and could have helped to predict which pests were likely candidates for control by chemical means and which were not.},

  abstract            = {The population dynamics of a general three-species, three-trophic-level exploitational system are explored. The conclusions pertaining to three levels are much the same as those for two. Exploitation is defined as one species using another to satisfy its reproductive requirements while the other suffers reproductive depression because of the interaction. Exploitation is the only interspecific interaction assumed to exist in the system. Other assumptions of the theory include: (a) it is possible to construct a first-order partial, nonlinear, differential equation for each species which will predict the population dynamics of that species (such equations do not exist today because of our ignorance); (b) carnivores exploit herbivores, herbivores exploit plants; (c) both herbivores and plants exhibit intraspecific competition at high densities and intraspecific mutualism at low densities. The mutualism may be only technical and requires only that the victim's predators exert a diminishing effect on each victim as victim population increases; (d) carnivores have no intraspecific interaction; (e) habitats are homogeneous in space and time; and (f) populations are phenotypically homogeneous. These assumptions are used to construct the general zero isoclines for each species. From linear approximations of the isoclines, one can determine dynamics near any possible community equilibria. For an equilibrium point to be stable, the plants' intraspecific competition must overshadow their mutualism near that equilibrium. If the same is true of herbivores, the equilibrium is a steady state. If not, it may still be a steady state, provided the herbivore mutualism is weak, herbivore and carnivore interactions are generally weak, and all plant interactions are strong. The population dynamics of the species may or may not exhibit oscillations. As in the two-species model, natural selection can destabilize the equilibrium. Addition of the third or carnivore species always increases the equilibrium density of plants. But its effect on herbivore density is not predictable without knowledge of the dynamics of the two-species system to which it is added. Addition of the carnivore may not only increase both plant and herbivore densities, it may also stabilize them. Thus, removal of carnivores is a perilous ecological gamble. Because of the nonlinear properties of an exploitative system, measurement of interaction coefficients in one small region of phase space does not yield information about stability in other regions.},

Variations of the graph are introduced, and it is shown that an otherwise unstable interaction may be stabilized by the presence of either an inviolable prey hiding place, or extremely low predation pressure at moderate predator and high prey densities, or another predator-limiting resource. Stability is always conferred when the predator is severely limited at its equilibrium density by one of its resources other than its supply of prey. Predators should tend to be limited at their equilibrium densities by more than one of their resources. When either of the two foregoing situations pertains, regular predator-prey oscillations should not be observable. The stability of the interaction close to equilibrium was found to depend exclusively, in the mathematically-continuous model, upon the slopes of two lines in the graph at equilibrium. Stability can be asymptotic rather than oscillatory in type. An equation for the period of oscillatory interactions is also advanced. The effects of Natural Selection on the isoclines, and thus the stability, is not clear-cut. Selection of the prey tends to stabilize the interaction; the opposite is true for selection on the predator.},

  abstract  = {Indirect interactions as mediated by higher and lower trophic levels have been advanced as key forces structuring herbivorous arthropod communities around the globe. Here, we present a first quantification of the interaction structure of a herbivore-centered food web from the High Arctic. Targeting the Lepidoptera of Northeast Greenland, we introduce generalized overlap indices as a novel tool for comparing different types of indirect interactions. First, we quantify the scope for top-down-up interactions as the probability that a herbivore attacking plant species i itself fed as a larva on species j. Second, we gauge this herbivore overlap against the potential for bottom-up-down interactions, quantified as the probability that a parasitoid attacking herbivore species i itself developed as a larva on species j. Third, we assess the impact of interactions with other food web modules, by extending the core web around the key herbivore Sympistis nigrita to other predator guilds (birds and spiders). We find the host specificity of both herbivores and parasitoids to be variable, with broad generalists occurring in both trophic layers. Indirect links through shared resources and through shared natural enemies both emerge as forces with a potential for shaping the herbivore community. The structure of the host-parasitoid submodule of the food web suggests scope for classic apparent competition. Yet, based on predation experiments, we estimate that birds kill as many (8%) larvae of S. nigrita as do parasitoids (8%), and that spiders kill many more (38%). Interactions between these predator guilds may result in further complexities. Our results caution against broad generalizations from studies of limited food web modules, and show the potential for interactions within and between guilds of extended webs. They also add a data point from the northernmost insect communities on Earth, and describe the baseline structure of a food web facing imminent climate change.},

Experiments were performed to compare the foraging tactics of this invading species to those of its most abundant competitors, highly social stingless bees of the genera Melipona and Trigona. In an area containing a rich assemblage of stingless bees in French Guiana, Africanized honeybees were significantly more abundant on honey-water feeders during a high @'nectar flow@' period than combined stingless bee and wasp species. During the last 15 min of the experiments, when bait was not replenished on feeders, Africanized honeybees abandoned the feeders but native foragers continued to arrive. None of the stingless bees, including four aggressive Trigona, displaced from the feeders the foragers of several (two to seven) colonies of Africanized honeybees. The cost of attacking Africanized honeybees at feeders apparently exceeded the benefit for large, aggressive Trigona williana and T. hyalinata branneri. These bees abandoned feeders visited by nonaggressive Africanized honeybees. Single, small Africanized honeybee colonies were displaced from feeders by aggressive foragers of T. Pallens pallens and T. h. branneri. In one instance Africanized honeybeeys shifted almost immediately to a floral resource, while abandonment of the feeders by T. williana was not followed by a shift to a natural food source. Reduction of competitive interaction with Africanized honeybees was accomplished by foragers of T. clavipes and T. p. pallens that partitioned four feeders by visiting only two, leaving the other to Africanized bees. Interspecific displacement was never absolute; a few foragers from a displaced colony always visited the feeders. Africanized honeybees and Melipona fulva foraged nonaggressively both at feeders and flowers, but Africanized bees at feeders exhibited low levels of aggression toward Melipona and polybiine wasps on one occasion. Unlike other aggressive Trigona, T. clavipes was at times unaggressive. Colonies of T. h. branneri and Africanized honeybees, the bees most successful in displacing other species from feeders, were comprised of many more workers than colonies of the other bees. The combined advantages of (1) the ability to communicate the distance and direction of a food source from the nest, (2) large forager size, and (3) large colony size provide Africanized honeybee colonies with a competitive ability superior to that of stingless bees at rich, compact resources.},

  abstract  = {Colony foraging activity of four Melipona species (Apidae: Meliponinae, tribe Meliponini) was studied during the dry season, when many plants flower in central Panama. The efficiency of sucrose solution uptake by Melipona was compared to that of domesticated European Apis mellifera. Dynamics of nectar foraging were also recorded for 3 of the Melipona visiting the forest shrub, Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae). 1. Sugar concentration in nectar brought to nests averaged from 21 to 60{\%} sugar for 15 colonies of M. fasciata, M. compressipes triplaridis, M. fuliginosa and M. marginata micheneri. Concentrations ranged from 19 to 72{\%}, and all species collected nectars ranging at least between 24 and 63{\%} sugar. However, M. compressipes and M. marginata preferred higher concentrations and foraged less on dilute nectars. Peak colony nectar harvest occured in late morning or early afternoon; peak pollen harvest was in early morning. 2. Imbibing rates of bees given 20, 30, 45, 60 or 70{\%} sucrose solutions were highest at <=45{\%} sucrose, but caloric intake was most rapid at 60{\%} sucrose for all species. All but M. marginata displayed greater net intake rates than domesticated European Apis mellifera. A foraging choice model incorporating caloric reward and imbibing rates of bees suggests M. compressipes and M. marginata should specialize on richer nectars. Rate of caloric intake per forager weight was higher for all Melipona (0.03--0.13g) than for A. mellifera (0.10 g). 3. The nectar of Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae), a shrub pollinated exclusively by Melipona, progressed from 35 to 60{\%} sugar during the day. Bees foraged most when nectar was below 60{\%} concentration, a pattern best explained as the result of intercolony competition and greater availability of lower quality nectar. 4. Sugar concentration in nectar harvested by colonies rose from lower to higher values through the day for Melipona. The increasing caloric reward of nectar is adaptive in exploiting foraging preferences of such bees. As standing nectar crop is depleted by competing bees, a gradual shift to more rewarding nectar should promote increased bee foraging range, more flower visits during a foraging trip, floral constancy, and genetic outcrossing. 5. The nectar load capacity of A. mellifera is greater than that of Melipona. Other factors being equal, Africanized A. mellifera, now a permanent resident of neotropical forests, should visit more flowers during a foraging trip. Additional species differences in foraging behavior are analyzed.},

  abstract  = {Recent declines of bee species have led to great interest in preserving and promoting bee populations for agricultural and wild plant pollination. Many correlational studies have examined the indirect effects of factors such as landscape context and land management practices and found great variation in bee response. We focus here on the evidence for effects of direct factors (i.e., food resources, nesting resources, and incidental risks) regulating bee populations and then interpret varied responses to indirect factors through their species-specific and habitat-specific effects on direct factors. We find strong evidence for food resource availability regulating bee populations, but little clear evidence that other direct factors are commonly limiting. We recommend manipulative experiments to illuminate the effects of these different factors. We contend that much of the variation in impact from indirect factors, such as grazing, can be explained by the relationships between indirect factors and floral resource availability based on environmental circumstances.},

Here I study how ideal directed movement—in which individuals travel in the direction offering the most immediate perceived improvement to their personal fitness—dictates the spatial position of two populations occupying the same relative niche and engaged in competition via interference to an individual’s ability to gather resources. Drawing on the analytic derivation of equilibria, numerical simulations, and graphical assessments, I provide conditions under which sympatry, parapatry, or regional exclusion is expected during different phases of the community’s development. I also demonstrate that specific competitive asymmetries produce distinguishable distributions and invasion patterns and identify which populations are found centrally or peripherally. Dynamic and dispersal equilibria were examined for differences in the sensitivity to spatial variations in fitness, per capita mortality, metabolic efficiency, the strength of interspecific interference, resource collection speed, and the optimal location of each population along an environmental cline. These asymmetries were studied both in isolation and pairwise in fitness trade-off scenarios.},

  abstract   = {The relationship between a response variable and one or more continuous covariates is often curved. Attempts to represent curvature in single- or multiple-regression models are usually made by means of polynomials of the covariates, typically quadratics. However, low order polynomials offer a limited family of shapes, and high order polynomials may fit poorly at the extreme values of the covariates. We propose an extended family of curves, which we call fractional polynomials, whose power terms are restricted to a small predefined set of integer and non-integer values. The powers are selected so that conventional polynomials are a subset of the family. Regression models using fractional polynomials of the covariates have appeared in the literature in an ad hoc fashion over a long period; we provide a unified description and a degree of formalization for them. They are shown to have considerable flexibility and are straightforward to fit using standard methods. We suggest an iterative algorithm for covariate selection and model fitting when several covariates are available. We give six examples of the use of fractional polynomial models in three types of regression analysis: normal errors, logistic and Cox regression. The examples all relate to medical data: fetal measurements, immunoglobulin concentrations in children, diabetes in children, infertility in women, myelomatosis (a type of leukaemia) and leg ulcers.},

  abstract  = {Understanding the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on bees is vital because of reported declines in bee diversity and distribution and the crucial role bees have as pollinators in ecosystems and agriculture. Neonicotinoids are suspected to pose an unacceptable risk to bees, partly because of their systemic uptake in plants, and the European Union has therefore introduced a moratorium on three neonicotinoids as seed coatings in flowering crops that attract bees. The moratorium has been criticized for being based on weak evidence, particularly because effects have mostly been measured on bees that have been artificially fed neonicotinoids. Thus, the key question is how neonicotinoids influence bees, and wild bees in particular, in real-world agricultural landscapes. Here we show that a commonly used insecticide seed coating in a flowering crop can have serious consequences for wild bees. In a study with replicated and matched landscapes, we found that seed coating with Elado, an insecticide containing a combination of the neonicotinoid clothianidin and the non-systemic pyrethroid beta-cyfluthrin, applied to oilseed rape seeds, reduced wild bee density, solitary bee nesting, and bumblebee colony growth and reproduction under field conditions. Hence, such insecticidal use can pose a substantial risk to wild bees in agricultural landscapes, and the contribution of pesticides to the global decline of wild bees may have been underestimated. The lack of a significant response in honeybee colonies suggests that reported pesticide effects on honeybees cannot always be extrapolated to wild bees.},

  abstract  = {Organic farming has been suggested to counteract declines in farmland biodiversity, but comparisons to conventional farming have produced variable outcomes. To examine whether this is due to the landscape context farms are situated in and traits of the studied organisms, we surveyed bumble bees in cereal field borders and margins at 12 pairs of matched organic and conventional farms, with half the pairs located in heterogeneous farmland and the remaining in homogeneous plains. Species richness and abundance of bumble bees were significantly positively related to both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity. However, there was an interaction effect between farming practice and landscape context so that species richness and abundance were only significantly higher on organic farms in homogeneous landscapes. The higher abundance of bumble bees on organic farms was partly related to higher flower abundance on these sites. The effect of landscape context on bumble bee abundance was stronger for species with medium sized colonies than for those with smaller and larger colony sizes. These patterns may reflect that species with medium sized foraging ranges are most affected by fragmentation of foraging habitat, because colony size reflects the spatial scale at which bumble bees utilize resources. We conclude that both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity can be used to increase bumble bee species richness and abundance, but that organic farming has a larger effect in homogeneous landscapes and landscape heterogeneity a larger effect on conventional farms. The effects differed between species, suggesting that a single prescription to increase pollinator abundance may not be valid.},

  abstract  = {Spatiotemporal resource continuity promotes persistence of mobile animal populations. Current agricultural landscapes are poor in flowers resources for bumble bees. Available forage crops are predominantly early-season mass-flowering crops (MFC). It has been suggested, but not tested, that scarcity of late-season flower resources are limiting bumble bee populations. We examined whether addition of late-season flowering red clover affected worker, queen and male bumble bee densities. Bumble bees were surveyed in flower-rich uncultivated field borders across 24 landscapes (radius 2 km) with or without a clover field in the centre, varying in semi-natural grassland (SNG) and early MFC availability. Clover fields had over ten times higher worker densities compared to field borders, suggesting red clover as favoured forage. Five times more queens and 71% more males were found in landscapes with clover fields compared to control landscapes, despite these fields constituting less than 0.2% of the landscape area. Both MFC and SNG increased the density of males, but only in the presence of clover fields. Our results suggest that late-flowering red clover positively affects bumble bee reproduction, likely by increasing temporal resource continuity. Interventions such as flower strips can thus have mitigating effects if they release population regulation by late-season resource bottle-necks},

This paper presents ideas that integrate these three variables into a new formula for estimating \{NPP\} of large areas. The three key variables needed, LAI, intercepted shortwave radiation (Qint), and surface temperature (Tgrow) are all measurable by current satellites. Consequently, a first dynamic estimate of global terrestrial \{NPP\} may now be possible integrating satellite measurements with simple ecosystem models of carbon conversion efficiency.},

  abstract  = {Climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions is predicted to raise the mean global temperature by 1.0--3.5degreesC in the next 50--100 years. The direct and indirect effects of this potential increase in temperature on terrestrial ecosystems and ecosystem processes are likely to be complex and highly varied in time and space. The Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems core project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme has recently launched a Network of Ecosystem Warming Studies, the goals of which are to integrate and foster research on ecosystem-level effects of rising temperature. In this paper, we use meta-analysis to synthesize data on the response of soil respiration, net N mineralization, and aboveground plant productivity to experimental ecosystem warming at 32 research sites representing four broadly defined biomes, including high (latitude or altitude) tundra, low tundra, grassland, and forest. Warming methods included electrical heat-resistance ground cables, greenhouses, vented and unvented field chambers, overhead infrared lamps, and passive night-time warming. Although results from individual sites showed considerable variation in response to warming, results from the meta-analysis showed that, across all sites and years, 2--9 years of experimental warming in the range 0.3--6.0degreesC significantly increased soil respiration rates by 20\% (with a 95\% confidence interval of 18--22\%), net N mineralization rates by 46\% (with a 95\% confidence interval of 30--64\%), and plant productivity by 19\% (with a 95\% confidence interval of 15--23\%). The response of soil respiration to warming was generally larger in forested ecosystems compared to low tundra and grassland ecosystems, and the response of plant productivity was generally larger in low tundra ecosystems than in forest and grassland ecosystems. With the exception of aboveground plant productivity, which showed a greater positive response to warming in colder ecosystems, the magnitude of the response of these three processes to experimental warming was not generally significantly related to the geographic, climatic, or environmental variables evaluated in this analysis. This underscores the need to understand the relative importance of specific factors (such as temperature, moisture, site quality, vegetation type, successional status, land-use history, etc.) at different spatial and temporal scales, and suggests that we should be cautious in ``scaling up'' responses from the plot and site level to the landscape and biome level. Overall, ecosystem-warming experiments are shown to provide valuable insights on the response of terrestrial ecosystems to elevated temperature.},

  abstract  = {Differences in the transport rate and size of bedload exist for varying levels of flow in coarse-grained channels. For gravel-bed rivers, at least two phases of bedload transport, with notably differing qualities, have been described in the literature. Phase I consists primarily of sand and small gravel moving at relatively low rates over a stable channel surface. Transport rates during Phase {II} are considerably greater than Phase I and more coarse grains are moved, including material from both the channel surface and subsurface. Transition from Phase I to Phase {II} indicates initiation and transport of grains comprising the coarse surface layer common in steep mountain channels. While the existence of different phases of transport is generally acknowledged, the threshold between them is often poorly defined. We present the results of the application of a piecewise regression analysis to data on bedload transport collected at 12 gravel-bed channels in Colorado and Wyoming, {USA.} The piecewise regression recognizes the existence of different linear relationships over different ranges of discharge. The inflection, where the fitted functions intersect, is interpreted as the point of transition from Phase I to Phase {II} transport; this is termed breakpoint. A comparison of grain sizes moved during the two phases shows that coarse gravel is rarely trapped in the samplers during Phase I transport, indicating negligible movement of grains in this size range. Gravel larger than about D16 of the channel surface is more consistently trapped during Phase {II} transport. The persistence of coarse gravel in bedload samples provides good evidence that conditions suitable for coarse grain transport have been reached, even though the size of the sediment approaches the size limits of the sampler (76 mm in all cases). A relative breakpoint {(Rbr)} was defined by the ratio between the discharge at the breakpoint and the 1Â.5-year flow (a surrogate for bankfull discharge) expressed as a percentage. The median value of Rbr was about 80 percent, suggesting that Phase {II} begins at about 80 percent of the bankfull discharge, though the observed values of Rbr ranged from about 60 to 100 percent. Variation in this value appears to be independent of drainage area, median grain size, sorting of bed materials, and channel gradient, at least for the range of parameters measured in 12 gravel-bed channels.

  abstract  = {Abstract The introduction of exotic bees for crop pollination is an increasingly common practice worldwide. While beneficial for crop production, exotic species may become invasive with several deleterious ecological and economic impacts. We studied whether robbing of flower buds by a highly invasive bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) reduces nectar availability for managed honey bees (Apis mellifera). We assessed the proportion of robbed buds, and nectar availability in flowers and buds (robbed and non-robbed) in 16 raspberry fields along gradients of bumble bee and honey bee abundance in \{NW\} Patagonia, Argentina. We also measured nectar production and replenishment in flowers that developed from robbed and non-robbed buds in one experimental field. Across fields, the proportion of robbed buds increased with the abundance of bumble bees, but not of honey bees. At anthesis, flowers from buds that were robbed once contained half the nectar, and produced two thirds of the nectar compared to those flowers that had not been robbed. Therefore, high abundance of invasive bumble bees can reduce resources for managed honey bees by robbing flower buds. This study reveals a novel, negative impact of bumble bee invasions that could potentially affect honey production.},

Colonies were installed in different fields of canola in the Chaudiere-Appalaches (two replicates) and Quebec City (one replicate) regions to create a density gradient of zero to three colonies per hectare. To calculate the blooming period under these conditions, 10 labelled plants were caged in the field, out of the reach of pollinators, and 10 others were labelled in the field and exposed to foragers. The number of flowers found on each plant was recorded daily. This study also aims at demonstrating that the canola plant will produce new flowers as long as it does not reach its maximum carrying capacity, thereby extending the blooming period. To simulate the fall of unfertilized flowers, a predetermined number of flowers from 20 randomly selected plants in one of the replicates were cut off every day. The plant, when it reaches its maximum carrying capacity, stops producing new flowers. With three colonies per hectare, the blooming period was reduced by 3.8 days, or 17 % compared with in the absence of pollinators. Because of the efficient pollen transfer to the stigma, the honeybees do not only cause the flower to live for a shorter period of time, but they also bring about a decrease in the number of flowers produced by the plant, thereby reducing the duration of blooming period.},

Although the importance of pollination has been shown for the production of seed crops, the need to introduce bee hives in canola fields during flowering to increase oil seed yield has not yet been proven. With the purpose of showing this, hives of A. mellifera were grouped and placed in various canola fields in the Chaudiere-Appalaches and Capitale-Nationale regions (nine fields; three blocks with three treatments; 0, 1.5, and 3 hives per hectare). A cage was used to exclude pollinators and bee visitations were observed in each field. After the harvest, yield analyses were done in relation to the bee density gradient created, by using pod set, number of seeds per plant, and weight of 1000 seeds. Results showed an improvement in seed yield of 46% in the presence of three honey bee hives per hectare, compared with the absence of hives. The introduction of honey bees contributed to production and consequently, these pollinators represented a beneficial and important pollen vector for the optimal yield of canola.},

Weberbauerocereus weberbaueri is a self-compatible columnar cactus that is visited and pollinated by one species of rare endemic bat, Platalina genovensium, and two species of hummingbirds, Patagona gigas and Rhodopis vesper. W. weberbaueri exhibits pronounced interplant variation in floral color and size, and flowers exhibit traits corresponding to both bat and hummingbird pollination syndromes. Starch-gel electrophoresis of flower bud tissue indicated that W. weberbaueri is an autotetraploid and that genetic diversity ($H{ep} = 0.257$) of the study population was high relative to diploid plants but similar to other tetraploid species. Initial fruit set from pollinator exclusion experiments conducted in 1991 and 1993, at the onset of and after a drought associated with the El Ninio event of 1991-1992, revealed that bats were the most important pollinators in 1991, but that hummingbirds and diurnal insects were most important in 1993. In both years, however, autogamy and lepidopteran larval infestation of fruits reduced differences in mature fruit production among pollinator exclusion treatments so that differences in mature fruit set were not statistically significant. Reduced bat pollination in 1993 is attributed to the reduced abundance of bats at the study site during a drought caused by El Niiio. I hypothesize that interaction among several factors, including tetraploidy, autogamy, larval infestation of developing fruits, and variation in pollinator abundance, may not result in strong selection for a bat vs. hummingbird floral morph, thus allowing the persistence of floral variation in this cactus.},

  abstract  = {Plant-pollinator interactions are one of the most important and variable mutualisms in nature. Multiple pollinators often visit plants and can vary in visitation rates, pollen removal and deposition, and spatial and temporal distribution, altering plant reproduction and patterns of pollinator-mediated selection. Although some visitors may not be effective pollinators, pollinator effectiveness is rarely estimated directly as seed set resulting from a single visit by each taxon visiting generalist plants. For two years, effectiveness of visitors to wild radish, Raphanus raphanistrum, was quantified by counting seeds set and pollen grains removed as a result of a single visit. We calculated a pollinator's importance to plant reproduction as the product of visitation rate and single-visit seed set, and regressed pollinator body size on pollen-removal and on seed set effectiveness. Although pollinators differed in effectiveness and visitation rates, pollinator importance was primarily determined by visitation rates. In contrast to similar 2-yr studies, pollinator assemblage composition varied little, suggesting pollinator-mediated selection can be consistent across years for this generalist. Larger pollinators were more effective than smaller at effecting seed set, but body size was a poor predictor of pollen removal ability. Instead, pollen-removal effectiveness may be more influenced by foraging behavior than size.},

  abstract  = {Diversification of field edges is widely used as a strategy to augment pollinator populations and, in turn, supplement crop pollination needs. Hedgerow plantings, a commonly applied field-scale diversification technique, have been shown to increase wild bee richness within edges and into crop fields; however, their effects on pollination services in mass-flowering, pollinator-dependent crops typical of large-scale commercial monocultures are less well-known. We evaluated the indirect contribution of hedgerows to sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seed set vis-á-vis wild bee abundance and the interaction between wild bees and managed honey bee pollinators. Although wild bee species richness and the interaction between wild and managed pollinators were significantly associated with augmented seed set, these factors were unrelated to whether a hedgerow was present. The pollinator species foraging within crop fields differed significantly from those found within adjacent hedgerows and bare or weedy field edges, with hedgerows supporting higher species richness than crop fields or unenhanced edges. However, in an independent data set, greater numbers of sunflower-pollinating bees were found in hedgerows than in control edges. Hedgerows may therefore help these crop-pollinating species persist in the landscape. Our findings suggest that hedgerows may not always simultaneously achieve crop pollination and wild bee conservation goals; instead, the benefits of hedgerows may be crop- and region-specific. We recommend evaluation of hedgerow benefits in a variety of crop and landscape contexts to improve their ability to meet ecosystem-service provisioning needs.},

We address three types of plant-pollinator interactions — filtering, facilitation and competitive exclusion — and their predicted impacts on communities. The few available studies that address how pollinator-mediated interactions limit or promote plant species establishment and persistence provide support for many of these predictions.

Support for this paradigm is presented in an evidence-based conceptual model structured around five evidence statements highlighting emerging trends applicable to sustainable agriculture. The full range of benefits and costs associated with animal activities in agroecosystems cannot be quantified by focusing on single species groups, crops, or systems. Management of productive agroecosystems should sustain cycles of ecological interactions between crops and wild animals, not isolate these cycles from the system. Advancing this paradigm will therefore require integrated studies that determine net returns of animal activity in agroecosystems.},

It is suggested that these observations are consistent with a simple graphical model relating the standing crop of available nectar to foraging energetics and the additional costs of colonial life (cost of sociality). Temporal variations in foraging behavior were also observed, with Apis again preferring to forage at those times of day (early morning and late afernoon) when resources were most abundant. Bombus was less crepuscular than Apis, and carpenter bees foraged without obvious regard to variation in standing crop. Several factors which may account for this pattern are discussed.},

Transgenic and non-transgenic plants of the cultivar Westar were planted in a 1.1 ha field trial, with the transgenic plants in a 9 m diameter circle at the centre, surrounded by non-transgenic plants to a distance of at least 47 m in all directions. A 1 m circle of non-transgenic plants was sown in the centre of the transgenic area to allow estimation of the level of pollen dispersal when plants were in close contact. Honeybee hives were placed at the trial site to optimize the opportunity for cross-pollination. During the flowering period, regular observations were made of the number of plants flowering and the number and type of insects present in 60 1 m 2 areas. These areas were located uniformly around the plot at distances of 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 47 m from the edge of the 9 m circle of transgenic plants. Seed samples were harvested from each of the 7 distances so that approximately 20% of the circumference of the plot was sampled at each distance. The centre non-transgenic circle was also sampled. Plants were grown from the seed samples and sprayed with glufosinate to estimate the frequency of pollen dispersal at each distance. In order to screen enough samples to detect low frequency cross-pollination events, seed samples were tested in the greenhouse and on a larger scale in the field. Results were confirmed by testing progeny for glufosinate resistance and by Southern blot analysis. The estimated percentage of pollen dispersal in the non-transgenic centre circle was 4.8%. The frequency was estimated to be 1.5% at a distance of I m and 0.4% at 3 m. The frequency decreased sharply to 0.02% at 12 m and was only 0.00033% at 47 m. No obvious directional effects were detected that could be ascribed to wind or insect activity.},

This might, however, be inefficient, and demands for agricultural products limit the feasibility of converting arable land into natural habitat. To develop more targeted means to promote ecosystem services, we need a solid understanding of the limitations to population growth for service-providing organisms. We propose a research agenda that identifies resource bottlenecks and interruptions over time to key beneficial organisms, emphasising their resulting population dynamics. Targeted measures that secure the continuity of resources throughout the life cycle of service-providing organisms are likely to effectively increase the stock, flow, and stability of ecosystem services.},

  abstract  = {Evidence for declining populations of both wild and managed bees has raised concern about a potential global pollination crisis. Strategies to mitigate bee loss generally aim to enhance floral resources. However, we do not really know whether loss of preferred floral resources is the key driver of bee decline because accurate assessment of host plant preferences is difficult, particularly for species that have become rare. Here we examine whether population trends of wild bees in The Netherlands can be explained by trends in host plants, and how this relates to other factors such as climate change. We determined host plant preference of bee species using pollen loads on specimens in entomological collections that were collected before the onset of their decline, and used atlas data to quantify population trends of bee species and their host plants. We show that decline of preferred host plant species was one of two main factors associated with bee decline. Bee body size, the other main factor, was negatively related to population trend, which, because larger bee species have larger pollen requirements than smaller species, may also point toward food limitation as a key factor driving wild bee loss. Diet breadth and other potential factors such as length of flight period or climate change sensitivity were not important in explaining twentieth century bee population trends. These results highlight the species-specific nature of wild bee decline and indicate that mitigation strategies will only be effective if they target the specific host plants of declining species.},

Because nectar is the principal source of energy, efficient foraging for nectar should be expected. This study investigates the question of whether an easily observed component of efficient nectar-collecting, the crop load gathered in a patch, can be predicted by using simple economic principles. 
(2) Individual bees were trained to collect sugar solution from artificial flowers in the field. They were tested both by experimentally mimicking different densities and distances of flowers from the hive, and by offering different concentrations and volumes of `nectar' that the bees received per flower visit. 
(3) Crop load can be predicted quantitatively with the assumption that bees maximize energetic efficiency in an average foraging excursion, i.e. the ratio of net energetic gain to energetic costs of nectar collection. The finding is remarkable because it encompasses a broad range of ecological conditions. 
(4) The evidence from this and related studies suggests that energetic efficiency is a guiding principle underlying strategies of nectar-collection in the honeybee. How this principle might relate to reproductive success of the colony is discussed.},

This behaviour does not maximise the net rate of energy extraction from the food sources, and thus contradicts predictions of some common models for central place foragers. We show that including the metabolic costs of transport of nectar leads to models that predict partial crop-loading. Furthermore, the observed crop loads of honeybees are less consistent with those predicted by maximization of delivery rate to the hive (net energetic gain/ unit time), than with those predicted by maximization of energetic efficiency (net energetic gain/unit energy expenditure). We argue that maximization of energetic efficiency may be an adaptation to a limited flight-cost budget. This constraint is to be expected because a worker's condition seems to deteriorate as a function of the amount of flight performed.},

  abstract            = {(1) An inverse relationship between the effort an animal invests into current activities and its expected future life duration is important for life-history traits and, in particular, would provide a connection between foraging strategy and life-time fitness. Energetically low-cost foraging strategies such as those practised by nectar-collecting workers of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) are considered to be adaptive if foraging effort reduces life span (Schmid-Hempel et al. 1985). We here tested whether there is an inverse relationship between foraging activity and life span. (2) Workers of a colony were individually marked, placed at random into one of five treatment groups and their activities and life span observed. Treatments differed in the length of time individual bees were allowed to leave the hive to forage within an 8-h period each day (with schedules systematically altered from day to day). During the treatment period, individuals of the 0-h group could never leave the hive, those in other groups were allowed to exit the hive for 2, 4, 6 or 8 h (i.e. always). Sliding doors at the hive entrance were operated by an observer to ensure that only the appropriate individuals were kept back while others could forage freely. (3) There were no differences among groups in average adult life span (ecolosion to last observation) (for individuals in the 0-h group: 41.6+-2.0 S.E. days, N=49; 2 h: 41.3+-1.9, N=59; 4 h: 41.9+-1.8, N=57; 6 h: 45.1+-2.2, N=46; 8-h: 39.0+-2.3, N=49), despite differences in the number of foraging trips per individual/treatment period, and despite a threefold increase across treatment groups in the total number and duration of trips over the entire life span. In pairwise comparisons, average life span of workers in the 8 h group was shorter than those of workers in the 6 h group. (4) Within groups, however, there was a significant negative correlation between life span and number of trips per period, or time out of the hive per period, respectively. This relationship was largely due to hard-working individuals. We also found a significant positive correlation between the average amount of time a bee spent inactive in the hive, rather than being active, and its life span. We conclude that a reduction in the average work load below what bees accept under natural conditions (such as tested here) would not significantly lengthen life span of workers, but that life span might be reduced if bees increased their work load.},

It occurs in many plant species and is often associated with chimeric mitochondrial open reading frames. In a number of cases, transcripts originating from these altered open reading frames are translated into unique proteins that appear to interfere with mitochondrial function and pollen development. Nuclear restorer (Rf or Fr ) genes function to suppress the deleterious effects of CMS-associated mitochondrial abnormalities by diverse mechanisms. There are now several well-characterized CMS systems, for which the mitochondrial sequences thought to be responsible have been described. Possible mechanisms by which nuclear restoration occurs in these systems can now be postulated.},

This study explores pollinator service versus disservice in lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) production. This crop is highly managed, requires insect pollination, and has a relatively long bloom; when combined, these characteristics may cause a portion of early season pollination to result in premature ripening and loss. To test this, we exposed early and late flowering clones to early season (wild) pollination only or late season (wild and managed) pollination only. Contrary to our hypothesis of disservice, pre-harvest loss, shatter, and sugar content were consistent across treatments, even though early season pollination plots exhibited heavier berries. Remarkably, early season pollination plots produced over 70% of the total production of late season pollination plots. These results suggest that early season pollination by wild pollinators does not present an ecosystem disservice to lowbush blueberry production.},

Since different environmental drivers rarely act in isolation it is important to consider interactive effects. Here, we focus on how two key drivers of anthropogenic environmental change, climate change and the introduction of alien species, affect plant-pollinator interactions. Based on a literature survey we identify climatically sensitive aspects of species interactions, assess potential effects of climate change on these mechanisms, and derive hypotheses that may form the basis of future research. We find that both climate change and alien species will ultimately lead to the creation of novel communities. In these communities certain interactions may no longer occur while there will also be potential for the emergence of new relationships. Alien species can both partly compensate for the often negative effects of climate change but also amplify them in some cases. Since potential positive effects are often restricted to generalist interactions among species, climate change and alien species in combination can result in significant threats to more specialist interactions involving native species.},

Animal abundance is about ten times greater in Costa Rican lowland wet forest than in Borneo. Radically different routes and rates of energy flow are postulated to account for the difference. In a series of upland (1010-1425 m) samples in the Philippines, the number of litter lizards and frogs increases with elevation. A single upland (1200 m) Costa Rican sample contains about three times as many animals per 100 m2 as two lowland sites. This increase with altitude correlates well with hypotheses that overall tropical forest productivity is greatest at intermediate elevations. Herpetofaunal densities are greater in wet areas compared to dry sites and flat terrain compared to slopes. These observations are linked to the greater variation and lesser total litter fall in dry sites and/or slopes. The number of species of amphibians and lizards regularly inhabiting the litter is similar in all wet lowland forests studied. Increasing elevation and decreasing rainfall correlate with faunas having fewer species. The former is seen as the result of the differential ability of lowland species to invade uplands, and the latter as a decrease in the kind and duration of frog-spawning sites. Reduced equitability with increasing elevation is principally due to the much greater proportional increase of the commonest species. In the evolution of American and Bornean-Philippine wet lowland faunas, frogs with direct development (Eleutherodactylus) have radiated in the former in the same fashion that skinks have in the latter.},

  abstract  = {Pest management practices may be contributing to a decline in wild bee populations in or near canola (Brassica napus L.) agroecosystems. The objective of this study was to investigate the direct contact toxicity of five technical grade insecticides{\textemdash}imidacloprid, clothianidin, deltamethrin, spinosad, and novaluron{\textemdash}currently used, or with potential for use in canola integrated pest management on bees that may forage in canola: common eastern bumble bees [Bombus impatiens (Cresson); hereafter bumble bees], alfalfa leafcutting bees [Megachile rotundata (F.)], and Osmia lignaria Cresson. Clothianidin and to a lesser extent imidacloprid were highly toxic to all three species, deltamethrin and spinosad were intermediate in toxicity, and novaluron was nontoxic. Bumble bees were generally more tolerant to the direct contact applications \&gt; O. lignaria \&gt; leafcutting bees. However, differences in relative toxicities between the three species were not consistent, e.g., whereas clothianidin was only 4.9 and 1.3{\texttimes} more toxic, deltamethrin was 53 and 68{\texttimes} more toxic to leafcutting bees than to bumble bees and O. lignaria, respectively. Laboratory assessment of direct contact toxicity, although useful, is only one measure of potential impact, and mortality under field conditions may differ greatly depending on management practices. Research conducted using only honey bees as the indicator species may not adequately reflect the risk posed by insecticides to wild bees because of their unique biology and differential susceptibility. Research programs focused on determining nontarget impact on pollinators should be expanded to include not only the honey bee but also wild bee species representative of the agricultural system under investigation.},

  abstract  = {Forager honey bees function not only as gatherers of food for their colonies, but also as sensory units shaped by natural selection to gather information regarding the location and profitability of forage sites. They transmit this information to colony members by means of waggle dances. To investigate the way bees transduce the stimulus of nectar-source profitability into the response of number of waggle runs, I performed experiments in which bees were stimulated with a sucrose solution feeder of known profitability and their dance responses were videorecorded. The results suggest that several attributes of this transduction process are adaptations to enhance a bee's effectiveness in reporting on a forage site. (1) Bees register the profitability of a nectar source not by sensing the energy gain per foraging trip or the rate of energy gain per trip, but evidently by sensing the energetic efficiency of their foraging. Perhaps this criterion of nectar-source profitability has been favored by natural selection because the foraging gains of honey bees are typically limited by energy expenditure rather than time availability. (2) There is a linear relationship between the stimulus of energetic efficiency of foraging and the response of number of waggle runs per dance. Such a simple stimulus-response function appears adequate because the range of suprathreshold stimuli (max/min ratio of about 10) is far smaller than the range of responses (max/min ratio of about 100). Although all bees show a linear stimulus-response function, there are large differences among individuals in both the response threshold and the slope of the stimulus-response function. This variation gives the colony a broader dynamic range in responding to food sources than if all bees had identical thresholds of dance response. (3) There is little or no adaptation in the dance response to a strong stimulus (tonic response). Thus each dancing bee reports on the current level of profitability of her forage site rather than the changes in its profitability. This seems appropriate since presumably it is the current profitability of a forage site, not the change in its profitability, which determines a site's attractiveness to other bees. (4) The level of forage-site quality that is the threshold for dancing is tuned by the bees in relation to forage availability. Bees operate with a lower dance threshold when forage is sparse than when it is abundant. Thus a colony utilizes input about a wide range of forage sites when food is scarce, but filters out input about low-reward sites when food is plentiful. (5) A dancing bee does not present her information in one spot within the hive but instead distributes it over much of the dance floor. Consequently, the dances for different forage sites are mixed together on the dance floor. This helps each bee following the dances to take a random sample of the dance information, which is appropriate for the foraging strategy of a honey bee colony since it is evidently designed to allocate foragers among forage sites in proportion to their profitability.},

  abstract  = {To understand how a colony of honeybees keeps its forager force focussed on rich sources of food, and analysis was made of how the individual foragers within a colony decide to abandon or continue working (and perhaps even recruit to) patches of flowers. A nectar forager grades her behavior toward a patch in response to both the nectar intake rate of her colony and the quality of her patch. This results in the threshold in patch quality for acceptance of a patch being higher when the colonial intake rate of nectar is high than when it is low. Thus colonies can adjust their patch selectivity so that they focus on rich sources when forage is abundant, but spread their workers among a wider range of sources when forage is scarce. Foragers assess their colony's rate of nectar intake while in the nest, unloading nectar to receiver bees. The ease of unloading varies inversely with the colonial intake rate of nectar. Foragers assess patch quality while in the field, collecting nectar. By grading their behavior steeply in relation to such patch variables as distance from the nest and nectar sweetness, foragers give their colony high sensitivity to differences in profitability among patches. When a patch's quality declines, its foragers reduce their rate of visits to the patch. This diminishes the flow of nectar from the poor patch which in turn stimulates recruitment to rich patches. Thus a colony can swiftly redistribute its forager force following changes in the spatial distribution of rich food sources. The fundamental currency of nectar patch quality is not net rate of energy intake, (Gain-Cost)/Time, but may be net energy efficiency, (Gain-Cost)/Cost.},

Here, we explore, for the first time, land cover changes in England over more than 80 years, and relate them to concurrent shifts in bee and wasp species richness and community composition. Using historical data from 14 sites across four counties, we quantify the key land cover changes within and around these sites and estimate the changes in richness and composition of pollinators. Land cover changes within sites, as well as changes within a 1 km radius outside the sites, have significant effects on richness and composition of bee and wasp species, with changes in edge habitats between major land classes also having a key influence. Our results highlight not just the land cover changes that may be detrimental to pollinator communities, but also provide an insight into how increases in habitat diversity may benefit species diversity, and could thus help inform policy and practice for future land management.},

  abstract  = {Recent declines in managed honey bee, Apis mellifera L., colonies have increased interest in the current and potential contribution of wild bee populations to the pollination of agricultural crops. Because wild bees often live in agricultural fields, their population density and contribution to crop pollination may be influenced by farming practices, especially those used to reduce the populations of other insects. We took a census of pollinators of squash and pumpkin at 25 farms in Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland to see whether pollinator abundance was related to farming practices. The main pollinators were Peponapis pruinosa Say; honey bees, and bumble bees (Bombus s). The squash bee was the most abundant pollinator on squash and pumpkin, occurring at 23 of 25 farms in population densities that were commonly several times higher than that of other pollinators. Squash bee density was related to tillage practices: no-tillage farms hosted three times as great a density of squash bees as tilled farms. Pollinator density was not related to pesticide use. Honey bee density on squash and pumpkin was not related to the presence of managed honey bee colonies on farms. Farms with colonies did not have more honey bees per flower than farms that did not keep honey bees, probably reflecting the lack of affinity of honey bees for these crops. Future research should examine the economic impacts of managing farms in ways that promote pollinators, particularly pollinators of crops that are not well served by managed honey bee colonies.},

  abstract  = {Ecologists have taken two distinct approaches in studying the distribution and diversity of communities: a species-centric focus and an interaction-network based approach. A current frontier in community-level studies is the integration of these perspectives by investigating both simultaneously; one method for achieving this is evaluating the relative contributions of species turnover and host switching towards interaction turnover (i.e., the dissimilarity in interactions between two networks). We performed observations of plant-pollinator interactions to investigate (1) patterns in interaction turnover across spatial, temporal, and environmental gradients and (2) the relative contribution of pollinator species turnover, floral turnover, simultaneous pollinator & floral turnover, and host switching towards interaction turnover. Field work was conducted on the Beartooth Plateau, an alpine ecosystem in Montana and Wyoming, with weekly observations of plant-pollinator interactions across one growing season. Interaction turnover increased through time, with magnitudes consistently greater than 80%, even at time intervals as short as one week. Floral species turnover (41%) and simultaneous floral and pollinator species turnover (36%) accounted for almost all interaction turnover while host switching accounted for only 5%. Interaction turnover also significantly increased with spatial and elevational distance, albeit with lesser magnitudes than with temporal distance. The marginal spatial pattern was present for only some taxa (Bombus spp. and solitary bee species), potentially indicating variable habitat use by pollinators across the landscape. Weak environmental trends may be a consequence of unmeasured environmental variables, yet our finding that environmental gradients structure plant-pollinator interaction partitions had not previously been tested with empirical data. Our observations suggest that host switching does not readily occur at the scales of alpine flowering phenology (i.e., ~1 week); however, whether lack of host switching is indicative of inflexible pollinator foraging, or, more likely, a lack of opportunity or necessity to switch hosts, requires further investigation.},

Flowering overlap is one essential requirement for hybrid formation. Hybridization can occur between canola and its wild relative, wild radish. We studied the effects of wild radish plant density and date of emergence, canola (glyphosate resistant) planting dates, presence of other weeds, and presence of a wheat crop on the synchrony of flowering between wild radish and canola (as a crop and volunteer). Four field experiments were conducted from 2000 to 2002 in St-David de Lévis, Québec. Flowering periods of wild radish emerging after glyphosate application overlapped with early-, intermediate-, and late-seeded canola 14, 26, and 55%, respectively, of the total flowering time. Flowering periods of early-emerging wild radish and canola volunteers in uncropped treatments overlapped from mid-June until the end of July, ranging from 26 to 81% of the total flowering time. Flowering periods of wild radish and canola volunteers emerging synchronously on May 30 or June 5 as weeds in wheat overlapped 88 and 42%, respectively, of their total flowering time. For later emergence dates, few flowers or seeds were produced by both species because of wheat competition. Wild radish density in canola and wild radish and canola volunteer densities in wheat did not affect the mean flowering dates of wild radish or canola. Increasing wild radish density in uncropped plots (pure or weedy stands) hastened wild radish flowering. Our results show that if hybridization is to happen, it will be most likely with uncontrolled early-emerging weeds in crops or on roadsides, field margins, and uncultivated areas, stressing the need to control the early flush of weeds, weedy relatives, and crop volunteers in noncrop areas.},

  abstract  = {In less than 20 years, neonicotinoids have become the most widely used class of insecticides with a global market share of more than 25%. For pollinators, this has transformed the agrochemical landscape. These chemicals mimic the acetylcholine neurotransmitter and are highly neurotoxic to insects. Their systemic mode of action inside plants means phloemic and xylemic transport that results in translocation to pollen and nectar. Their wide application, persistence in soil and water and potential for uptake by succeeding crops and wild plants make neonicotinoids bioavailable to pollinators at sublethal concentrations for most of the year. This results in the frequent presence of neonicotinoids in honeybee hives. At field realistic doses, neonicotinoids cause a wide range of adverse sublethal effects in honeybee and bumblebee colonies, affecting colony performance through impairment of foraging success, brood and larval development, memory and learning, damage to the central nervous system, susceptibility to diseases, hive hygiene etc. Neonicotinoids exhibit a toxicity that can be amplified by various other agrochemicals and they synergistically reinforce infectious agents such as Nosema ceranae which together can produce colony collapse. The limited available data suggest that they are likely to exhibit similar toxicity to virtually all other wild insect pollinators. The worldwide production of neonicotinoids is still increasing. Therefore a transition to pollinator-friendly alternatives to neonicotinoids is urgently needed for the sake of the sustainability of pollinator ecosystem services.},

We then investigated whether socially salient cues are used preferentially over non-social ones in variable environments. Although bees clearly used social cues in highly variable environments, under the same conditions they did not use non-social cues.

  abstract  = {Gene flow is a key factor in the spatial genetic structure in spatially distributed species. Evolutionary biologists interested in microevolutionary processess and conservation biologists interested in the impact of landscape change require a method that measures the real time process of gene movement. We present a novel two-generation (parent-offspring) approach to the study of genetic structure (TwoGener) that allows us to quantify heterogeneity among the male gamete pools sampled by maternal trees scattered across the landscape and to estimate mean pollination distance and effective neighborhood size. First, we describe the model's elements: genetic distance matrices to estimate intergametic distances, molecular analysis of variance to determine whether pollen profiles differ among mothers, and optimal sampling considerations. Second, we evaluate the model's effectiveness by simulating spatially distributed populations. Spatial heterogeneity in male gametes can be estimated by FT, a male gametic analogue of Wright's FST and an inverse function of mean pollination distance. We illustrate TwoGener in cases where the male gamete can be categorically or ambiguously determined. This approach does not require the high level of genetic resolution needed by parentage analysis, but the ambiguous case is vulnerable to bias in the absence of adequate genetic resolution. Finally, we apply TwoGener to an empirical study of Quercus alba in Missouri Ozark forests. We find that Theta_FT= 0.06, translating into about eight effective pollen donors per female and an effective pollination neighborhood as a circle of radius about 17 m. Effective pollen movement in Q. alba is more restricted than previously realized, even though pollen is capable of moving large distances. This case study illustrates that, with a modest investment in field survey and laboratory analysis, the TwoGener approach permits inferences about landscape-level gene movements.},

Bumble bees, Bombus impatiens Cresson, were similarly tested in 1 yr; their pollination activities were minimal, and weight of seed produced on female lines in tents containing bumble bees was similar to that in tents without pollinators. Leafcutting bee activity, as measured by the number of female bees at the entrance to tunnels in the hive, at first increased, then decreased with increasing stocking rate. Duration of time spent visiting flowers did not vary with stocking rate, but was longer on male-fertile than on male-sterile flowers. Production of hybrid seed within tents varied with leafcutting bee stocking rate, with the highest seed yield achieved at stocking rates equivalent to three charges at weekly intervals of 400 000 leafcutting bees per hectare. At optimum LCB stocking rates, the method described provided sufficient seed quantity for small-plot multi-location field evaluation of oilseed rape hybrids.},

But it has not been clear if observed benefits of floral enhancements result from greater population growth, which is critical for the long-term success of conservation, or from mobile foragers aggregating in high-resource locations. Experimental evidence is only beginning to emerge in favor of the former mechanism and it is not well-established how different aspects of floral resources affect population growth. For example, bumble bee colonies may benefit from greater overall floral abundance, richness, or relative dominance of resource species. Because bumble bees are highly mobile, resource variability in the surrounding landscape is also important for colonies and may mediate local-scale effects. We experimentally assessed the growth and reproduction of bumble bee colonies (Bombus impatiens) deployed in grasslands in different local- and landscape-scale resource environments. We found that floral dominance, rather than the overall abundance or richness of floral resources, was the most important local factor for colony growth and reproduction. This may reflect more efficient foraging on a few numerically dominant and abundant resource species. Local- and landscape-scale predictor variables had interacting effects on colony growth and reproduction, suggesting that foraging distance depends on where in the landscape efficiently used resources are located. Our results provide further evidence that conservation strategies aimed at enhancing floral resources can increase bumble bee population growth. However, the most effective form of floral enhancement may vary among bee species.},

As an often neglected but important group of pollinators, they play a significant role in agrobiodiversity and the biodiversity of plants everywhere. Flies are present in almost all habitats and biomes and for many medicinal, food and ornamental plants, pollinating flies guarantee or enhance seed and fruit production. They are important in the natural landscape, in agriculture and in greenhouses, and have recently come into use in the production of seeds for seed banks. The São Paulo Pollinator Initiative, the CBD, and Pollinator secretariats were important starting points in the international recognition of pollinator importance. However, large gaps in our knowledge of the role of Diptera in pollination networks need to be addressed in order to sustain agriculture and to enable appropriate responses to climate change. At this 9th Conference of the Parties we would like to draw attention to the role of often-neglected Dipteran pollinators, to stress their current importance and potential future use as pollinators in agriculture. A case study on flower flies that act as important pollinators, as adults, and major biocontrol agents, as larvae, illustrates their double importance for agriculture.},

As a mass-flowering crop, oilseed rape has received much focus in terms of its pollination requirements but despite a threefold increase in area of cultivation of this crop in Ireland over the past 5 years, little is known about its pollination here. We surveyed the flower visiting insects found in commercial winter oilseed rape fields and evaluated the importance of different pollinator groups, investigated the contribution of insect pollination to oilseed rape seed production, and estimated the economic value of insect pollination to the crop at a national level. Our data showed that winter oilseed rape is visited by a wide variety of insect species, including the honeybee, bumblebees, solitary bees, and hoverflies. The honeybee, Eristalis hoverflies and bumblebees (especially Bombus sensu stricto and B. lapidarius) were the best pollinators of winter oilseed rape based on the number of pollen grains they carry, visitation rates per flower and their relative abundance per field. Exclusion of pollinators resulted in a 27 %decrease in the number of seeds produced, and a 30 % decrease in seed weight per pod in winter crops, with comparable values from a spring oilseed rape field also. The economic value of insect pollination to winter oilseed rape was estimated as €2.6 million per annum, while the contribution to spring oilseed rape was €1.3 million, resulting in an overall value of €3.9 million per annum. We can suggest the appropriate conservation and management of both honeybees and wild pollinators in agricultural areas to ensure continued provision of pollination services to oilseed rape, as a decrease in insect numbers has the potential to negatively influence crop yields},

* Individual foragers from pesticide-exposed colonies carried out longer foraging bouts than untreated controls (68 vs. 55 min). Pesticide-exposed bees also brought back pollen less frequently than controls indicating reduced foraging performance.
* A higher proportion of bees from pesticide-exposed colonies returned when released 1 km from their nests; this is potentially related to increased orientation experience during longer foraging bouts. We measured no impact of pesticide exposure on homing ability for bees released from 2 km, or when data were analysed overall.
* Despite a trend for control colonies to produce more new workers earlier, we found no overall impacts of pesticide exposure on whole colony size.
* Synthesis and applications. This study shows that field-realistic neonicotinoid exposure can have impacts on both foraging ability and homing success of bumblebees, with implications for the success of bumblebee colonies in agricultural landscapes and their ability to deliver crucial pollination services. Pesticide risk assessments should include bee species other than honeybees and assess a range of behaviours to elucidate the impact of sublethal effects. This has relevance for reviews of neonicotinoid risk assessment and usage policy world-wide.},

The system consist of mini digital recorder (mini-DVR) with a video motion detection (VMD) sensor which detects changes in the image captured by the camera, the intruder triggers the recording immediately. The sensitivity and the detection area are adjustable, which may prevent unwanted recordings. To our best knowledge this is the first study using VMD sensor to monitor flower-visiting insects. Observation of flower-visiting insects has traditionally been monitored by direct observations, which is time demanding, or by continuous video monitoring, which demands a great effort in reviewing the material. A total of 98.5 monitoring hours were conducted. For the mini-DVR with VMD, a total of 35 min were spent reviewing the recordings to locate 75 pollinators, which means ca. 0.35 sec reviewing per monitoring hr. Most pollinators in the order Hymenoptera were identified to species or group level, some were only classified to family (Apidae) or genus (Bombus). The use of the video monitoring system described in the present paper could result in a more efficient data sampling and reveal new knowledge to pollination ecology (e.g. species identification and pollinating behaviour).},

Pollinator treatments comprised of high pollinator density (a small honeybee colony and 10 mason bees, Osmia rufa), and a gradient of increasing O. rufa densities from zero (control) up to 100 bees per cage. High pollinator densities increased the seed weight per plant from 6.5 g to 56.9 g for the MS line. However seed weight did not differ between high pollinator densities and controls for the MF line. Increasing densities of O. rufa had a significant effect on almost all yield components of the MS line, but only marginal effects on the MF line. The number of seeds per pod, the seed weight per plant and the harvest index (seed weight/plant dry weight) of the MS line showed a significantly steeper increase with increasing bee density than that of the MF line. The results suggest that solitary bees could be used successfully to replace honeybees as pollinators of MS oilseed rape in isolation cages.},
  comment   = {Similar to McVetty et al, male-sterile canola plants significantly benefited from pollination, but the increase was not as dramatic for male-fertile plants. 

Since this was done in caged nets, it is uncertain if these densities of visitors would apply to actual practices. Hand-pollination may have helped by demonstrating maximum yield.},

  abstract  = {Honeybees communicate the distance and location of resource patches by bee dances, but this spatial information has rarely been used to study their foraging ecology. We analysed, for the first time to the best of the authors' knowledge, foraging distances and dance activities of honeybees in relation to landscape structure, season and colony using a replicated experimental approach on a landscape scale. We compared three structurally simple landscapes characterized by a high proportion of arable land and large patches, with three complex landscapes with a high proportion of semi-natural perennial habitats and low mean patch size. Four observation hives were placed in the centre of the landscapes and switched at regular intervals between the six landscapes from the beginning of May to the end of July.

A total of 1137 bee dances were observed and decoded. Overall mean foraging distance was 1526.1 ± 37.2 m, the median 1181.5 m and range 62.1 - 10 037.1 m. Mean foraging distances of all bees and foraging distances of nectar-collecting bees did not significantly differ between simple and complex landscapes, but varied between month and colonies. Foraging distances of pollen-collecting bees were significantly larger in simple (1743 ± 95.6 m) than in complex landscapes (1543.4 ± 71 m) and highest in June when resources were scarce. Dancing activity, i.e. the number of observed bee dances per unit time, was significantly higher in complex than in simple landscapes, presumably because of larger spatial and temporal variability of resource patches in complex landscapes. The results facilitate an understanding of how human landscape modification may change the evolutionary significance of bee dances and ecological interactions, such as pollination and competition between honeybees and other bee species.},

  abstract  = {Most ecological processes and interactions depend on scales much larger than a single habitat, and therefore it is important to link spatial patterns and ecological processes at a landscape scale. Here, we analyzed the effects of landscape context on the distribution of bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) at multiple spatial scales with respect to the following hypotheses: (1) Local abundance and diversity of bees increase with increasing proportion of the surrounding seminatural habitats. (2) Solitary wild bees, bumble bees, and honey bees respond to landscape context at different spatial scales. 

We selected 15 landscape sectors and determined the percentage of seminatural habitats and the diversity of habitat types at eight spatial scales (radius 250-3000 m) by field inspections and analyses of vegetation maps using two Geographic Information Systems. The percentage of seminatural habitats varied between 1.4% and 28%. In the center of each landscape sector a patch of potted flowering plants (four perennial and two annual species) was placed in the same habitat type, a grassy field margin adjacent to cereal fields. In all, 865 wild bee individuals and 467 honey bees were observed and an additional 475 individuals were caught for species identifiwqcation. Species richness and abundance of solitary wild bees showed a close positive correlation with the percentage of seminatural habitats at small scales up to 750 m, whereas bumble bees and honey bees did not respond to landscape context at these scales. In contrast, honey bees were correlated with landscape context at large scales. The densities of flower-visiting honey bees even increased with decreasing proportion of seminatural habitats at a radius of 3000 m. We are not aware of any empirical studies showing contrasting foraging patterns related to landscape context at different spatial scales. We conclude (1) that local landscape destruction affects solitary wild bees more than social bees, possibly changing mutualistic plant-pollinator and competitive wild bees- honey bees interactions and (2) that only analyses of multiple spatial scales may detect the importance of the landscape context for local pollinator communities},

  abstract  = {The relative importance of bottom-up or top-down forces has been mainly studied for herbivores but rarely for pollinators. Habitat fragmentation might change driving forces of population dynamics by reducing the area of resource-providing habitats, disrupting habitat connectivity, and affecting natural enemies more than their host species. We studied spatial and temporal population dynamics of the solitary bee Osmia rufa (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) in 30 fragmented orchard meadows ranging in size from 0.08 to 5.8 ha in an agricultural landscape in central Germany. From 1998 to 2003, we monitored local bee population size, rate of parasitism, and rate of larval and pupal mortality in reed trap nests as an accessible and standardized nesting resource. Experimentally enhanced nest site availability resulted in a steady increase of mean local population size from 80 to 2740 brood cells between 1998 and 2002. Population size and species richness of natural enemies increased with habitat area, whereas rate of parasitism and mortality only varied among years. Inverse density-dependent parasitism in three study years with highest population size suggests rather destabilizing instead of regulating effects of top-down forces. Accordingly, an analysis of independent time series showed on average a negative impact of population size on population growth rates but provides no support for top-down regulation by natural enemies. We conclude that population dynamics of O. rufa are mainly driven by bottom-up forces, primarily nest site availability.},

Phenology, growth, and reproduction were monitored for 2 or 3 consecutive years. Increased temperature had little influence on the phenology of S. oppositifolia, although flowering period was somewhat longer and pollination earlier in the experimental plots. A decrease in the density of flowers on each plant was noted at two sites over 3 years, with a slightly larger decrease in the warmed plots. The few changes observed in reproductive variables (e.g. fruit : flower ratio) are mostly assigned to increased shading by taller growing neighbouring plants of other species, thus limiting performance of the shade-intolerant S. oppositifolia. It is assumed that survival of this species, especially at the lower limits of its altitudinal and latitudinal distribution, will depend on seed dispersal to new, open habitats.},

Saxifraga oppositifolia is a perennial herb with circumpolar distribution, and it is one of the earliest flowering species in its habitats. Late-flowering genets were found to have accelerated phenology; this was correlated with heat acumulation per day. Individual flowers were found to last for 11.7 d. Strongly protogynous flowers (female lasted 4.2 d), declining stigma receptivity at the time of anther dehiscence, and more or less simultaneous flowering within genets reduce the probability for self-pollination. High seed abortion in naturally pollinated flowers (seed:ovule ratio = 0.25) supports this prediction. Crossing experiments showed that seed set is very low from autodeposition of pollen, and almost as low from selfing. Reproductive success was found to be pollen limited.},

The traditional ideal-free distribution assumes discrete sites with definite boundaries, and predicts how many individuals should occupy each site. In contrast, the present analysis assumes that a forager's gains gradually decline with distance from a site, and asks where in space individuals ought to be. Although many interesting situations may arise, the analysis asks how individuals should position themselves as the distance between two identical sources increases. Nash equilibrium positions should follow a pitchfork pattern as the distance between sites is increased; that is, an individual should maintain a position between two sources when they are close together but should move nearer one of the sources when they are far apart. In addition, the text describes an experimental study that parallels the theoretical analysis. The experiment supports the predicted pitchfork pattern, and provides somewhat weaker support for the predicted differences in ''individual'' and ''paired'' pitchforks.},

  abstract  = {Correlative approaches to understanding the climatic controls of vegetation distribution have exhibited at least two important weaknesses: they have been conceptually divorced across spatial scales, and their climatic parameters have not necessarily represented aspects of climate of broad physiological importance to plants. Using examples from the literature and from the Sierra Nevada of California, I argue that two water balance parameters—actual evapotranspiration (AET) and deficit (D)—are biologically meaningful, are well correlated with the distribution of vegetation types, and exhibit these qualities over several orders of magnitude of spatial scale (continental to local). I reach four additional conclusions. (1) Some pairs of climatic parameters presently in use are functionally similar to AET and D; however, AET and D may be easier to interpret biologically. (2) Several well-known climatic parameters are biologically less meaningful or less important than AET and D, and consequently are poorer correlates of the distribution of vegetation types. Of particular interest, AET is a much better correlate of the distributions of coniferous and deciduous forests than minimum temperature. (3) The effects of evaporative demand and water availability on a site's water balance are intrinsically different. For example, the ‘dry’ experienced by plants on sunward slopes (high evaporative demand) is not comparable to the ‘dry’ experienced by plants on soils with low water-holding capacities (low water availability), and these differences are reflected in vegetation patterns. (4) Many traditional topographic moisture scalars—those that additively combine measures related to evaporative demand and water availability—are not necessarily meaningful for describing site conditions as sensed by plants; the same holds for measured soil moisture. However, using AET and D in place of moisture scalars and measured soil moisture can solve these problems.},

  abstract  = {Many small farmland ponds are built for nutrient retention, the conservation of biodiversity or both, yet they are relatively neglected habitats. For example, little is known about the potential for ponds to influence populations of beneficial terrestrial insects, deliver ecosystem services across the aquatic–terrestrial boundary and affect crop yield in insect-pollinated cash crops. We assessed whether the presence of a pond affects the abundance of pollinators and the quality and quantity of strawberry yield. We compared the abundance of pollinators and the quality and quantity of strawberries between habitats adjacent to the pond, semi-natural terrestrial habitat and field border without semi-natural vegetation (control habitat). We found significantly higher abundances of syrphids and bees next to ponds compared to control habitats. Also, syrphids were significantly more abundant at pond habitats compared to vegetation habitats and a similar tendency, although not significant, was found for the abundance of bees. The quantity and quality of strawberries was significantly higher near the vegetation and pond habitats compared to the control habitats. Our result supports the theory that the presence of semi-natural habitats, in the agricultural landscape benefits both public interest in biodiversity conservation and farmers’ interest in crop pollination. These benefits may also come from ponds as semi natural habitats. However, further studies are required to disentangle the effect of the pond per se and the effect of the associated terrestrial vegetation.},

  abstract  = {Research was done during 2012 to evaluate the potential exposure of pollinators to neonicotinoid insecticides used as seed treatments on corn, cotton, and soybean. Samples were collected from small plot evaluations of seed treatments and from commercial fields in agricultural production areas in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. In total, 560 samples were analyzed for concentrations of clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and their metabolites. These included pollen from corn and cotton, nectar from cotton, flowers from soybean, honey bees, Apis mellifera L., and pollen carried by foragers returning to hives, preplanting and in-season soil samples, and wild flowers adjacent to recently planted fields. Neonicotinoid insecticides were detected at a level of 1 ng/g or above in 23% of wild flower samples around recently planted fields, with an average detection level of about 10 ng/g. We detected neonicotinoid insecticides in the soil of production fields prior to planting at an average concentration of about 10 ng/g, and over 80% of the samples having some insecticide present. Only 5% of foraging honey bees tested positive for the presence of neonicotinoid insecticides, and there was only one trace detection (< 1 ng/g) in pollen being carried by those bees. Soybean flowers, cotton pollen, and cotton nectar contained little or no neonicotinoids resulting from insecticide seed treatments. Average levels of neonicotinoid insecticides in corn pollen ranged from less than 1 to 6 ng/g. The highest neonicotinoid concentrations were found in soil collected during early flowering from insecticide seed treatment trials. However, these levels were generally not well correlated with neonicotinoid concentrations in flowers, pollen, or nectar. Concentrations in flowering structures were well below defined levels of concern thought to cause acute mortality in honey bees. The potential implications of our findings are discussed.},

We assess the importance of body mass and the minimum ambient temperature at which foraging occurs in determining the warm-up rates and thoracic temperatures in flight at an air temperature of 22degreesC of 55 species of bee (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) from six families adapted to a variety of thermal environments.2. To control for the effects of taxonomic differences in the relationships between these variables, we use multiple regression incorporated in the phylogenetic regression method developed by Grafen (1989).3. The prediction made by May (1976) that for very small heterotherms warmup rate will correlate positively with body mass is confirmed when the effects of phylogeny and the thermal environment to which the bee is adapted have been controlled for. The relationship between warm-up rate and body mass within the Apoidea is thus not an extension to lower body masses of the relationship found for heterothermic vertebrates.4. Having controlled for the effects of body mass in our analyses, we demonstrate that bees able to fly at lower ambient temperatures have higher thoracic temperatures and warm-up rates than bees adapted to wanner environments.5. There is some suggestion that kleptoparasitic bees, being freed from the need to forage in order to provision cells, have lower warm-up rates than provisioning species.6. The significance of these relationships in the ecology of bees is discussed in relation to studies of body temperatures and warm-up rates in bees and other insects.},

  abstract  = {Predicting demographic consequences of climate change for plant communities requires understanding which factors influence seed set, and how climate change may alter those factors. To determine the effects of pollen availability, temperature, and pollinators on seed production in the alpine, we combined pollen-manipulation experiments with measurements of variation in temperature, and abundance and diversity of potential pollinators along a 400-m elevation gradient. We did this for seven dominant species of flowering plants in the Coast Range Mountains, British Columbia, Canada. The number of viable seeds set by plants was influenced by pollen limitation (quantity of pollen received), mate limitation (quality of pollen), temperature, abundance of potential pollinators, seed predation, and combinations of these factors. Early flowering species (n = 3) had higher seed set at high elevation and late-flowering species (n = 4) had higher seed set at low elevation. Degree-days >15 degreesC were good predictors of seed set, particularly in bee-pollinated species, but had inconsistent effects among species. Seed production in one species, Arnica latifolia, was negatively affected by seed-predators (Tephritidae) at mid elevation, where there were fewer frost-hours during the flowering season. Anemone occidentalis, a fly-pollinated, self-compatible species had high seed set at all elevations, likely due to abundant potential pollinators. Simultaneously measuring multiple factors affecting reproductive success of flowering plants helped identify which factors were most important, providing focus for future studies. Our work suggests that responses of plant communities to climate change may be mediated by flowering time, pollination syndrome, and susceptibility to seed predators.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we examine how ecological costs of resistance might be manifested through plant relationships with pollinators. If defensive compounds are incorporated into floral structures or if they are sufficiently costly that fewer rewards are offered to pollinators, pollinators may discriminate against more defended plants. Here we consider whether directional selection for increased resistance to herbivores could be constrained by opposing selection through pollinator discrimination against more defended plants. We used artificial selection to create two populations of Brassica rapa plants that had high and low myrosinase concentrations and, consequently, high and low resistance to flea beetle herbivores. We measured changes in floral characters of plants in both damaged and undamaged states from these populations with different resistances to flea beetle attack. We also measured pollinator visitation to plants, including numbers of pollinators and measures of visit quality (numbers of flowers visited and time spent per flower). Damage from herbivores resulted in reduced petal size, as did selection for high resistance to herbivores later in the plant lifetime. In addition, floral display (number of open flowers) was also altered by an interaction between these two effects. Changes in floral traits translated into overall greater use of low-resistance, undamaged plants based on total amount of time pollinators spent foraging on plants. Total numbers of pollinators attracted to plants did not differ among treatments; however, pollinators spent significantly more time per flower on plants from the low-resistance population and tended to visit more flowers on these plants as well. Previous work by other investigators on the same pollinator taxa has shown that longer visit times are associated with greater male and female plant fitness. Because initial numbers of pollinators did not differ between selection regimes, palatability and/or amount of rewards offered by high- and low-resistance populations are likely to be responsible for these patterns. During periods of pollinator limitation, less defended plants may have a selective advantage and pollinator preferences may mediate directional selection imposed by herbivores. In addition, if pollinator preferences limit seed set in highly defended plants, then lower seed set previously attributed to allocation costs of defense may also reflect greater pollinator limitation in these plants relative to less defended plants.},

  abstract  = {Fretwell's (1972, Populations in a Seasonal Environment, Princeton University Press) ideal tree model predicts the ideal distribution when individuals in a habitat are free to move between patches. In this paper, the relationship between the ‘continuous input’ and ‘interference’ ideal free models of Sutherland &amp; Parker (1985, In: Behavioural Ecology: Ecological Consequences of Adaptive Behaviour, ed. by R. M. Sibly &amp; R. H. Smith, pp. 255-274, Blackwell) and Parker &amp; Sutherland (1986, Anim. Behav., 34, 1222-1242) are examined. Continuous input describes cases where resource items arrive at patches containing groups of waiting competitors. Increasing their density in a patch reduces individual gain rates because the resource items arrive at a fixed rate, and are shared between competitors. Interference describes cases where foragers search for prey items hidden within the patches. Increasing competitor density in a patch can reduce individual gain rates due to interference between individuals. Both can be modelled using the form: individual gain rate = Qini-m, in which Qi is the input rate or prey density in patch i, ni is the number of competitors, and m is a constant which increases with the strength of interference. A previous formulation of the above model in which individuals have unequal competitive abilities is extended to cover the case where phenotypic differences are reflected by a scaling of Qi (rather than by a scaling of the level of m). Here, many different mixed distributions of phenotypes can exist as ideal free equilibria, provided that relative competitive abilities stay constant across patches. Many different phenotypes can occur across several patch types. However, where phenotypic differences are best reflected by a scaling of m, then these mixed distributions of phenotypes are not possible, and no more than one phenotype can play a mixed strategy across the same pair of patch types. Typically, a truncated distribution of phenotypes between the patches can be expected, with the best phenotypes in the best patches. Some general conditions are proposed for ideal free distributions of unequal competitors.},

  abstract  = {1. Enhancing key floral resources is essential to effectively mitigate the loss of pollinator diversity and associated provisioning of pollination functions in agro-ecosystems. However, effective floral provisioning measures may diverge among different pollinator conservation targets, such as the conservation of rare species or the promotion of economically important crop pollinators. We examined to what extent such diverging conservation goals could be reconciled.
2. We analysed plant–bee visitation networks of 64 herbaceous semi-natural habitats representing a gradient of plant species richness to identify key resource plants of the three distinct conservation target groups: rare bees (of conservation concern), dominant wild crop-pollinating bees, and managed crop-pollinating bees (i.e. honey bees).
3. Considering overall flower visitation, rare bees tended to visit nested subsets of plant species that were also visited by crop pollinators (46% and 77% nestedness in the dissimilarity between rare bees and wild crop pollinators or managed honey bees, respectively). However, the set of preferred plant species, henceforth ‘key plant species’ (i.e. those species disproportionately more visited than expected according to their floral abundance) was considerably more distinct and less nested among bee target groups.
4. Flower visits of all bee target groups increased with plant species richness at a similar rate. Importantly, our analyses revealed that an exponential increase in the flower abundance of the identified key plant species and complementarity in the bee visitation pattern across plant species - rather than total flower abundance - were the major drivers of these relationships.
5. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that the multiple goals of preserving high bee diversity, conserving rare species and sustaining crop pollinators can be reconciled if key plant species of different target groups are simultaneously available. This availability is facilitated by a high floral resource complementarity in the plant community. The list of identified key resource plant species we provide here can help practitioners such as land managers and conservationists to better design and evaluate pollinator conservation and restoration measures according to their goals. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying and promoting such plant species for pollinator conservation in agricultural landscapes.This article is protected by copyright.

The pistil provides everything the pollen requires for success in this endeavor including distinct guidance cues and essential nutrients that allow the pollen tube to traverse enormous distances along a complex path to the unfertilized ovule. Although the pistil is a great facilitator of pollen function, it can also be viewed as an elaborate barrier that shields ovules from access from inappropriate pollen, such as pollen from other species. Each discrete step taken by pollen tubes en route to the ovules is a potential barrier point to ovule access and waste by inappropriate mates. In this review, we survey the current molecular understanding of how pollination proceeds, and ask to what extent is each step important for mate discrimination. As this field progresses, this synthesis of functional biology and evolutionary studies will provide insight into the molecular basis of the species barriers that maintain the enormous diversity seen in flowering plants.},

  abstract  = {Akaike's information criterion (AIC) is increasingly being used in analyses in the field of ecology. This measure allows one to compare and rank multiple competing models and to estimate which of them best approximates the "true" process underlying the biological phenomenon under study. Behavioural ecologists have been slow to adopt this statistical tool, perhaps because of unfounded fears regarding the complexity of the technique. Here, we provide, using recent examples from the behavioural ecology literature, a simple introductory guide to AIC: what it is, how and when to apply it and what it achieves. We discuss multimodel inference using AIC—a procedure which should be used where no one model is strongly supported. Finally, we highlight a few of the pitfalls and problems that can be encountered by novice practitioners.},

In many species, the self-/nonself-recognition of SI is controlled by a single polymorphic locus, the S-locus. Molecular dissection of the S-locus revealed that SI represents not one system, but a collection of divergent mechanisms. Here, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of three distinct SI mechanisms, each controlled by two separate determinant genes at the S-locus. In the Brassicaceae, the determinant genes encode a pollen ligand and its stigmatic receptor kinase; their interaction induces incompatible signaling(s) within the stigma papilla cells. In the Solanaceae-type SI, the determinants are a ribonuclease and an F-box protein, suggesting the involvement of RNA and protein degradation in the system. In the Papaveraceae, the only identified female determinant induces a Ca2+-dependent signaling network that ultimately results in the death of incompatible pollen.},

This study focused on specialist and generalist species in plant-pollinator interactions and tested the hypothesis that plant and pollinator communities become more generalized as habitat loss increases. The study was made in seven selected sites in southern Ontario, Canada, at the level of landscape that is characterized by distributed forests within intensively managed agricultural fields. We quantified both the degree of habitat loss and the degree of specialization/generalization for each of the plant and insect communities using a sampling method of hexagonal transects. Regression analysis indicated a significant relationship between the increase of habitat loss and the shift to generalization in insect, but not in plant, communities. Our results suggest that, in plant-pollinator interactions, insect communities are more sensitive and/or quicker than plant communities to respond to the effects of habitat loss.},

  abstract  = {Global warming can lead to considerable impacts on natural plant communities, potentially inducing changes in plant physiology and the quantity and quality of floral rewards, especially nectar. Changes in nectar production can in turn strongly affect plant-pollinator interaction networks—pollinators may potentially benefit under moderate warming conditions, but suffer as resources reduce in availability as elevated temperatures become more extreme. Here, we studied the effect of elevated temperatures on nectar secretion of two Mediterranean Lamiaceae species—Ballota acetabulosa and Teucrium divaricatum. We measured nectar production (viz. volume per flower, sugar concentration per flower and sugar content per flower and per plant), number of open and empty flowers per plant, as well as biomass per flower under a range of temperatures selected ad hoc in a fully controlled climate chamber and under natural conditions outdoors. The average temperature in the climate chamber was increased every 3 days in 3 °C increments from 17.5 to 38.5 °C. Both study species showed a unimodal response of nectar production (volume per flower, sugar content per flower and per plant) to temperature. Optimal temperature for sugar content per flower was 25-26 °C for B. acetabulosa and 29-33 °C for T. divaricatum. According to our results, moderate climate warming predicted for the next few decades could benefit nectar secretion in T. divaricatum as long as the plants are not water stressed, but have a moderate negative effect on B. acetabulosa. Nevertheless, strong warming as predicted by climate change models for the end of the 21st century is expected to reduce nectar secretion in both species and can thus significantly reduce available resources for both wild bees and honeybees in Mediterranean systems.},
  comment   = {Studied temperature-nectar production responses of two Lamiaceae from the Mediterranean. Found that (surprise) it's unimodal, and they say that increases in future temperature could reduce nectar production.

This is really not that shocking. Plants have optimum ET values that they operate at, so it makes sense that it would start cutting off nectar production after certain temperatures. What's more interesting is that they imply (but don't show) that most plants are currently at their optimum temperature.},

We explored the combined effects of pollination and soil fertility in sunflower using soils from a trial characterized by different long-term input management in order to recreate plausible levels of soil fertility. Pollinator exclusion was used as a proxy for a highly eroded pollination service. Pollination benefits to yield depended on soil fertility, i.e., insect pollination enhanced seed set and yield only under higher soil fertility indicating that limited nutrient availability may constrain pollination benefits. Our study provides evidence for interactions between above- and belowground ecosystem services, highlighting the crucial role of soil fertility in supporting agricultural production not only directly, but also indirectly through pollination. Management strategies aimed at enhancing pollination services might fail in increasing yield in landscapes characterized by high soil service degradation. Comprehensive knowledge about service interactions is therefore essential for the correct management of ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes models of behavior for two ant species recruiting to very different sorts of resource. One species, Solenopsis geminata, recruits to sugar solution. The other, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, recruits to patches of seeds. The models clarify the assumptions entering into the theoretical analysis of these behaviors and point to measurements that should be made for their experimental analysis. Both models assume that the colony gains energy when a forager gets a load of resource. Energy is lost during the trip to a patch of resource in a manner dependent upon the current physical conditions of the environment. The only factor counterbalancing an ever increasing net energy gain when the recruitment rates are increased is interference among workers at a patch. As the rate of recruitment is elevated this interference decreases the efficiency with which the resource can be used and, thus, sets an optimum at some intermediate rate of recruitment. The limitation of considerations in this paper to energetic efficiency is discussed and justified in terms of components of fitness and ant physiology. It is found that several qualitative predictions can be experimentally tested, but that quantitative predictions require fine measurement of metabolic costs to individual foragers and of complicated gains to the colony as a whole. Both models can be differentiated experimentally from corresponding time minimization models.},

Two major threats to insect pollinators are anthropogenic land-use change and the spread of pathogens, whose effects may interact to impact pollination. Here, we investigated the relative effects on the ecosystem service of pollination of (i) land-use change brought on by agriculture and urbanization as well as (ii) the prevalence of pollinator parasites, using experimental insect pollinator-dependent plant species in natural pollinator communities. We found that pollinator habitat (i.e. availability of nesting resources for ground-nesting bees and local flower richness) was strongly related to flower visitation rates at the local scale and indirectly influenced plant pollination success. At the landscape scale, pollination was positively related to urbanization, both directly and indirectly via elevated visitation rates. Bumblebees were the most abundant pollinator group visiting experimental flowers. Prevalence of trypanosomatids, such as the common bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi, was higher in urban compared with agricultural areas, a relationship which was mediated through higher Bombus abundance. Yet, we did not find any top-down, negative effects of bumblebee parasitism on pollination. We conclude that urban areas can be places of high transmission of both pollen and pathogens.},

  abstract  = {Biological invasions represent both an increasingly important applied problem and a tool for gaining insight into the structure of ecological communities. Although competitive interactions between invasive and native species are considered among the most important mechanisms driving invasion dynamics, such interactions are in general poorly understood. The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a widespread and economically important invader long suspected to competitively suppress many native bee species. Yet the extent to which this introduced species alters native communities remains controversial, reflecting ongoing debate over the importance of resource competition in regulating pollinator populations. I experimentally tested the effects of competition with Apis on colony foraging behavior and reproductive success of a native eusocial bee, Bombus occidentalis Greene, in coastal California. B. occidentalis colonies located near experimentally introduced Apis hives had lower mean rates of forager return and a lower ratio of foraging trips for pollen relative to nectar. Both male and female reproductive success of B. occidentalis were also reduced with greater proximity to introduced Apis hives. Reproductive success correlated significantly with measures of colony foraging behavior, most strongly with the relative allocation of foraging effort to pollen collection. This pattern suggests that B. occidentalis colonies exposed to competition with Apis experienced increased nectar scarcity and responded by reallocating foragers from pollen to nectar collection, resulting in lowered rates of larval production. These results provide evidence that Apis competitively suppresses a native social bee known to be an important pollinator, with the potential for cascading effects on native plant communities. This work also contributes to a greater understanding of the role competitive interactions play in pollinator communities, particularly for social bees.},

pollinators. This gap is important given concerns about declines in some bee species. I monitored
honey bee (Apis mellifera) and bumble bee (Bombus spp.) foragers in coastal California from
1999, when feral A. mellifera populations were low due to Varroa destructor, until 2014. Apis mellifera
increased substantially, except between 2006 and 2011, coinciding with declines in managed
populations. Increases in A. mellifera strongly correlated with declines in Bombus and reduced diet
overlap between them, suggesting resource competition consistent with past experimental results.
Lower Bombus numbers also correlated with diminished floral resources. Declines in floral abundances
were associated with drought and reduced spring rainfall. These results illustrate how competition
with an introduced species may interact with climate to drive local decline of native
pollinators.},

Visitation rates by bumble bees, the principal pollinators, were then observed. In the reward-variation experiments, bees appeared to learn the positions of nectar-rich shoots, and visited them significantly more often than nectar-poor shoots. They did not respond to similar variation in pollen production. The nectar preferences developed slowly after the treatments were imposed, and bees continued to favor sites that had been occupied by nectar-rich shoots even after the treatments were discontinued. Visitation rate was approximately proportional to flower number, making it unlikely that increases in inflorescence size produced a disproportionate gain in male reproductive success (a necessary condition in certain models for the evolution of dioecy). For a fixed number of flowers per inflorescence, bees preferred inflorescences with more umbels. In pairwise choice tests of male-phase and female-phase umbels of various sizes, bees preferred male-phase umbels and larger umbels; the preference for male-phase umbels is stronger in bees that had previously fed on male-phase umbels.},

When other bees were removed to create localized ``competitive vacuums", the marked bees shifted their feeding activity toward the removal areas. Bees foraging in these competitive vacuums probed more flowers per inflorescence than control bees. One bee's foraging was studied intensively before and after its local competitors were removed. Compared to four nestmates foraging elsewhere, the focal bee's trip times were shorter (p<0.005) and its food collection rate was marginally higher (P= 0.064) during the removal, although all the bees foraged similarly before the removal. These observations indicate that traplining bumble bees opportunistically modify their use of space in response to the activities of other bees in a highly competitive environment.},

Nectar and pollen are released gradually through the day. Plants vary considerably in number of flowers per umbel and number of umbels per plant. The major pollinators, bumble bees, show several characteristic behaviors in response to the plant's presentation. 
1. Foraging bees preferentially visit umbels that bear large numbers of open, male-phase flowers. They also prefer shoots with large numbers of umbels. 
2. If bees have received high nectar rewards at one umbel, they are more likely to visit a neighboring umbel rather than leaving the area. On drained umbels, bees probe more empty flowers before rejecting the umbel if they have been rewarded just previously. 
3. Individual bees restrict their foraging to limited areas. Within these areas, they concentrate their visits on certain shoots which they tend to visit in repeatable sequences, or "traplines". It is inappropriate to consider these bees as "searching". 
4. We discuss some of the implications of these data for two areas of current theoretical interest: plant reproductive strategies and optimal foraging.},

Work on traplining is hampered by the lack of statistical, operational approaches for detecting its existence and measuring its strength. We propose several statistical procedures, illustrating them with records of interplant flight sequences by bumble bees visiting penstemon flowers. An asymmetry test detects deviations from binomial expectation in the directionality of visits between pairs of plants. Several tests compare data from one bee to another frequencies of visits to plants and frequencies of departures to particular destinations are compared using contingency tables; similarities of repeated sequences within bees are compared to those between bees by means of sequence alignment and Mantel tests. We also compared observed movement patterns to those generated by null models designed to represent realistic foraging by non-traplining bees, examining: temporal patterns of the bee's spatial displacement from its starting point using spectral analysis; the variance of return times to particular plants; and the sequence alignment of repeated cycles within sequences. We discuss the different indications and the relative strengths of these approaches},

  abstract  = {Arctic ecosystems are fragile, and are particularly sensitive to the pressures of climate change. Both average temperature and precipitation have increased over the past five decades on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada in the high Arctic. Altered growth forms and increased biomass in dominant plant species on Ellesmere Island have been observed concurrent with the changing climate, but shifts in the diversity or rank abundance of plant and bird species have not been detected. Changes in diversity may take longer to appear, or may be assessed better using organisms with shorter generation times such as insects. We explored the ecological impacts of climate change on Ellesmere Island using historical and contemporary communities of ichneumonid wasps. We compared community diversity, functional composition, and body size of two common species using ichneumonid specimens collected in 1961-1965, 1980-1982, 1989-1992, and 2010. We found high compositional similarity between collections, overlapping estimates of species richness, no change in the proportion of idiobiont genera in the community, and no clear pattern in body size over time. The greatest amount of variation over time was detected in parasitoids of herbivores; proportionally fewer herbivore-parasitizing genera were found in 2010 than in historical collections, and the two genera that were only found in one of the four collections were both parasitoids of herbivores. Our results point to the need to assess climate change effects in Arctic systems using a range of taxa, and responses to large-scale environmental disturbances may be idiosyncratic and difficult to predict.},

Despite this, some species initiate flowering late in the season, but little work has been done on the reproductive ecology of such species. This work investigates the reproductive consequences of late flowering in Leontodon autumnalis var. taraxaci in alpine southwest Norway during two seasons. In addition, the effects of an experimental increase in growing-season temperature on growth and reproduction are also examined. The reproductive success of Leontodon decreased strongly as the flowering season progressed, possibly as a result of increased climatic severity and increased extent of pollen and resource limitation on reproduction. Experimentally warmed plants produced significantly more and heavier seeds, and flowered more than 1 wk earlier than control plants, showing that temperature conditions influence both reproductive processes and flowering phenology. The results suggest that this late-flowering alpine species will bloom earlier, reproduce more, and grow larger under global warming.},

Flowers of Ranunculus acris tracked the sun during the day. Tracking accuracy was greatest during the middle of the day. The temperature elevation in flowers was negatively correlated with the flower's angle of deviation from the sun. Despite the increased temperature, insects did not discriminate among flowers on the basis of their angle of deviation from the sun, or tend to stay longer in the flowers aligned closest towards the sun. A tethering experiment was conducted on three groups of plants flowering at different times in the 1993 season and on one group the following season. Manipulation plants were constrained not to track the sun, whereas control plants tracked the sun naturally. Solar tracking had no effect on seed:ovule ratio, seed mass, or abortion rate in any of the groups. There is probably a very narrow range of weather conditions (cold, sunny, and calm) where flower heliotropism may enhance visitation rate to flowers and their seed production.},

Data were obtained by measuring the environmental factors and simultaneously observing the visitation activity to flowers within squares (1 × 1 m) for 10-min periods. Flies (Diptera) were the only flower visitors. In a simple linear regression analysis, mean daily temperature best explained the variation in mean daily visitation activity within the squares (R2 = 0.66). R2 increased to 0.74 in a multiple regression with all factors included. An unimodal progression in visitation activity was measured through the day, with peak visitation at 1200 h (solar time). Visitation activity was highest early in the flowering season (early July) and decreased as the season progressed (R2 = 0.21). Visitation was positively correlated with the daily mean flower density (R2 = 0.18). The flower density of individual species also affected visitation activity. Visitation reached a maximum level at medium flower densities, whereafter it stabilized, suggesting that the local visitor pool was saturated. The relationship between visitation activity and environmental factors at Finse, Norway, is similar to that found in {Alpine} U.S.A., Chile, and Australia.},

seed number per fruit by nearly 50% in the insect-pollinated willow, but had no significant impact on seed number in the dually
pollinated species. Fruit set was not affected by the treatment in either of the species. These results demonstrate that pollen limitation
on reproductive success is most pronounced in the species that depends entirely on insects for pollination. In general, pollinator
visitation was highest to S. lapponum, but bumble bees were only observed on S. lanata, suggesting that the quantity and quality of
pollinator visitation differed between the species. Our results empirically support the hypothesis that a dual pollination strategy is most
effective in alpine environments with low and infrequent pollinator activity and high wind speeds.},

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary This chapter reviews how the question of animal distributions has been approached from the point of view of individual behavior. The basis for much of the work on this subject has been the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) theory, which considers that the suitability of any area of the environment is a function of the density of competitors occurring there. The chapter reviews how ideal free theory has been developed and examines whether the predictions of \{IFD\} models are supported by experimental and field studies. Furthermore, the assumptions of equal competitive ability, omniscience, movement without costs and a single type of competition have all be shown to be inappropriate in many situations. When unequal competitors are considered, a range of new distributions are predicted including phenotypes being truncated across patches of different quality. Lack of omniscience and costs to movement also affect predicted distributions, leading to a greater use of poorer patches, with the magnitude of this effect dependent on the composition of the environment. Therefore, several different forms of competition have been identified, and a corresponding range of models and predictions formulated.},

This review revealed a number of previously ignored predictions and assumptions: in particular, there should be no change in relative patch use as competitor density changes. A new model is proposed in which interference results from the costs of encounters with other foragers and where the gains on a patch are independent of the costs of interference. This model predicts that as density increases, there will be increased proportional use of lower-quality patches. Past empirical studies of interference distributions are reanalyzed; none of the studies provides strong support for any of the existing ideal free-distribution models. We suggest that previous results are more consistent with the predictions of our new model.},

We tested these predictions in a study using different densities of the parasitoid wasp, Venturia canescens, foraging on patches containing different densities of its host, Plodia interpunctella. Our results support a number of the interference IFD model's general predictions. Gain rate decreased because of increased interference at higher density. Although gain rates on the two patches differed slighdy, this would be expected allowing for some sampling behavior and perceptual constraints. Early in each experiment when patch assessment is likely to occur, wasp movement was higher and gain rates lower. However, the more specific prediction of Sutherland's model, that proportional patch use should be constant and independent of density, was not upheld. Contemporary IFD models use only one of several equally valid potential relationships between gain rate, interference, and competitor density. The results of this study provide support for the additive model developed by Tregenza et al. (companion article).},

The ratio of the foraging range and/or dispersal ability to the distance between landscape elements influences local population dynamics. The spatial scale experienced by a species may be linked to its trophic level and also to traits such as body size, resource specialization, rarity, and population size variability. Hence, communities are assemblages of species with different spatial strategies. Effects of habitat loss and habitat fragmentation on plant-herbivore, herbivore-enemy, as well as plant-pollinator interactions are contingent on species and landscape. Metapopulation theory provides a unifying frame to approach plant-insect systems across fragmented landscape, although the landscape context is often ignored. In some cases theory is far ahead of empirical research. We call for more population data on large spatial and temporal scales to better understand plant-insect populations across fragmented landscapes.},

  abstract  = {Under the current scenario of rapid human population increase, achieving efficient and productive agricultural land use while conserving biodiversity is a global challenge. There is an ongoing debate whether land for nature and for production should be segregated (land sparing) or integrated on the same land (land sharing, wildlife-friendly farming). While recent studies argue for agricultural intensification in a land sparing approach, we suggest here that it fails to account for real-world complexity. We argue that agriculture practiced under smallholder farmer-dominated landscapes and not large-scale farming, is currently the backbone of global food security in the developing world. Furthermore, contemporary food usage is inefficient with one third wasted and a further third used inefficiently to feed livestock and that conventional intensification causes often overlooked environmental costs. A major argument for wildlife friendly farming and agroecological intensification is that crucial ecosystem services are provided by “planned” and “associated” biodiversity, whereas the land sparing concept implies that biodiversity in agroecosystems is functionally negligible. However, loss of biological control can result in dramatic increases of pest densities, pollinator services affect a third of global human food supply, and inappropriate agricultural management can lead to environmental degradation. Hence, the true value of functional biodiversity on the farm is often inadequately acknowledged or understood, while conventional intensification tends to disrupt beneficial functions of biodiversity. In conclusion, linking agricultural intensification with biodiversity conservation and hunger reduction requires well-informed regional and targeted solutions, something which the land sparing vs sharing debate has failed to achieve so far.},

  abstract  = {Understanding the negative and positive effects of agricultural land use for the conservation of biodiversity, and its relation to ecosystem services, needs a landscape perspective. Agriculture can contribute to the conservation of high-diversity systems, which may provide important ecosystem services such as pollination and biological control via complementarity and sampling effects. Land-use management is often focused on few species and local processes, but in dynamic, agricultural landscapes, only a diversity of insurance species may guarantee resilience (the capacity to reorganize after disturbance). Interacting species experience their surrounding landscape at different spatial scales, which influences trophic interactions. Structurally complex landscapes enhance local diversity in agroecosystems, which may compensate for local high-intensity management. Organisms with high-dispersal abilities appear to drive these biodiversity patterns and ecosystem services, because of their recolonization ability and larger resources experienced. Agri-environment schemes (incentives for farmers to benefit the environment) need to broaden their perspective and to take the different responses to schemes in simple (high impact) and complex (low impact) agricultural landscapes into account. In simple landscapes, local allocation of habitat is more important than in complex landscapes, which are in total at risk. However, little knowledge of the relative importance of local and landscape management for biodiversity and its relation to ecosystem services make reliable recommendations difficult.},

  abstract  = {Habitat destruction and fragmentation of remaining habitat are major threats to global biodiversity. In this paper, we drew upon data from grassland butterflies, legume-feeding herbivores and their parasitoids, and the interactions between rape pollen beetles and their parasitoids in the agricultural landscapes of Germany to explore the following issues: (1) the relative importance of small habitat fragments for the conservation of biodiversity (in contrast to the prevailing arguments in favor of large fragments); (2) the disruption of interspecific interactions in fragmented habitats; and (3) the relative importance of the spatial arrangement of habitat fragments in landscapes of different complexity.

The percentage of polyphagous butterfly species and their abundance were higher in small than in large calcareous grassland fragments, showing the relative importance of the landscape surrounding habitat fragments for less specialized species. A landscape perspective is also needed to explain why several small fragments supported more butterfly species (even when only endangered species were considered) than the same area composed of only one or two fragments. Analyses of insects on legumes showed trophic-level differences, in that species numbers of parasitoids, but not of herbivores, benefited from habitat subdivision in landscapes. As percentage of parasitism (i.e., the strength of ecological interactions) increased with fragment area, both the “several small” and “single large” strategies appeared to have merit. An intermediate-fragmentation strategy of habitat conservation in human-dominated landscapes may combine the advantages. Small habitat fragments should be scattered enough to cover a range of geographical area wide enough to maximize beta diversity and the spreading of risk, but with large habitat fragments close enough to enable dispersal among fragments, to reduce the extinction probability of area-sensitive species, and to stabilize predator–prey interactions.

Parasitism of rape pollen beetles exhibited a distinct edge effect: it was higher near the crop field edge, i.e., near the parasitoids' overwintering sites (such as grassy strips). However, this was only true in landscapes dominated by annual crops; in landscapes with a high percentage of permanent noncrop area (>20%), such edge effects disappeared, presumably because of the high overall density of these parasitoids. These data indicate that spatial configuration is important to mitigate extinction risks when habitat availability in a landscape is low, whereas no effect will be observed when overall area of habitat is high.},

In this review, we use knowledge gained from human-modified landscapes to suggest eight hypotheses, which we hope will encourage more systematic research on the role of landscape composition and configuration in determining the structure of ecological communities, ecosystem functioning and services. We organize the eight hypotheses under four overarching themes. Section A: ‘landscape moderation of biodiversity patterns' includes (1) the landscape species pool hypothesis—the size of the landscape-wide species pool moderates local (alpha) biodiversity, and (2) the dominance of beta diversity hypothesis—landscape-moderated dissimilarity of local communities determines landscape-wide biodiversity and overrides negative local effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. Section B: ‘landscape moderation of population dynamics' includes (3) the cross-habitat spillover hypothesis—landscape-moderated spillover of energy, resources and organisms across habitats, including between managed and natural ecosystems, influences landscape-wide community structure and associated processes and (4) the landscape-moderated concentration and dilution hypothesis—spatial and temporal changes in landscape composition can cause transient concentration or dilution of populations with functional consequences. Section C: ‘landscape moderation of functional trait selection’ includes (5) the landscape-moderated functional trait selection hypothesis—landscape moderation of species trait selection shapes the functional role and trajectory of community assembly, and (6) the landscape-moderated insurance hypothesis—landscape complexity provides spatial and temporal insurance, i.e. high resilience and stability of ecological processes in changing environments. Section D: ‘landscape constraints on conservation management' includes (7) the intermediate landscape-complexity hypothesis—landscape-moderated effectiveness of local conservation management is highest in structurally simple, rather than in cleared (i.e. extremely simplified) or in complex landscapes, and (8) the landscape-moderated biodiversity versus ecosystem service management hypothesis—landscape-moderated biodiversity conservation to optimize functional diversity and related ecosystem services will not protect endangered species. Shifting our research focus from local to landscape-moderated effects on biodiversity will be critical to developing solutions for future biodiversity and ecosystem service management.},

If not properly modeled, the presence of excess zeros can invalidate the distributional assumptions of the analysis, jeopardizing the integrity of the scientific inferences. The zeros can also create many computational difficulties. Recently, a fair amount of interest has concentrated on the analysis of zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) counts. Strictly speaking, however, the data need not follow a Poisson distribution in order to be zero inflated.

  abstract  = {The structure of mutualistic networks is likely to result from the simultaneous influence of neutrality and the constraints imposed by complementarity in species phenotypes, phenologies, spatial distributions, phylogenetic relationships, and sampling artifacts. We develop a conceptual and methodological framework to evaluate the relative contributions of these potential determinants. Applying this approach to the analysis of a plant–pollinator network, we show that information on relative abundance and phenology suffices to predict several aggregate network properties (connectance, nestedness, interaction evenness, and interaction asymmetry). However, such information falls short of predicting the detailed network structure (the frequency of pairwise interactions), leaving a large amount of variation unexplained. Taken together, our results suggest that both relative species abundance and complementarity in spatiotemporal distribution contribute substantially to generate observed network patters, but that this information is by no means sufficient to predict the occurrence and frequency of pairwise interactions. Future studies could use our methodological framework to evaluate the generality of our findings in a representative sample of study systems with contrasting ecological conditions.},

  abstract  = {Current predictions on species responses to climate change strongly rely on projecting altered environmental conditions on species distributions. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that climate change also influences species interactions. We review and synthesize literature information on biotic interactions and use it to argue that the abundance of species and the direction of selection during climate change vary depending on how their trophic interactions become disrupted. Plant abundance can be controlled by aboveground and belowground multitrophic level interactions with herbivores, pathogens, symbionts and their enemies. We discuss how these interactions may alter during climate change and the resulting species range shifts. We suggest conceptual analogies between species responses to climate warming and exotic species introduced in new ranges. There are also important differences: the herbivores, pathogens and mutualistic symbionts of range-expanding species and their enemies may co-migrate, and the continuous gene flow under climate warming can make adaptation in the expansion zone of range expanders different from that of cross-continental exotic species. We conclude that under climate change, results of altered species interactions may vary, ranging from species becoming rare to disproportionately abundant. Taking these possibilities into account will provide a new perspective on predicting species distribution under climate change.},

Here, we argue that multiple anthropogenic pressures - including land-use intensification, climate change, and the spread of alien species and diseases - are primarily responsible for insect-pollinator declines. We show that a complex interplay between pressures (eg lack of food sources, diseases, and pesticides) and biological processes (eg species dispersal and interactions) at a range of scales (from genes to ecosystems) underpins the general decline in insect-pollinator populations. Interdisciplinary research on the nature and impacts of these interactions will be needed if human food security and ecosystem function are to be preserved. We highlight key areas that require research focus and outline some practical steps to alleviate the pressures on pollinators and the pollination services they deliver to wild and crop plants.},

In this review, meta-analysis was used to analyze experiments on giving-up-densities in terrestrial systems to evaluate the overall magnitude of predation risk on foraging behavior and experimental conditions mediating its effect. Results indicate a large and significant decrease in foraging effort as a consequence of increased predation risk. Whether experiments were conducted under natural or artificial conditions produced no change in the overall effect predation had on foraging. Odor and live predators as a correlate of predation risk had weaker and nonsignificant effects compared to habitat characteristics. The meta-analysis suggests that the effect of predation risk on foraging behavior in terrestrial systems is strongly dependent on the type of predation risk being utilized.},

Over the range of observed weather values, A. mellifera activity was significantly dependent on temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed; O. cornuta activity was dependent on solar radiation and wind speed. These results were confirmed through video recordings at one O. cornuta nesting shelter and one A. mellifera hive. For both species, daily activity started at lower temperatures than it ceased, whereas solar radiation did not differ between these two events. In general, O. cornuta was active from 10 to 12C and 200 w/m2, and A. mellifera from 12 to 14C and 300 w/m2. O. cornuta was the only bee species seen visiting apple flowers under strong wind or light rain. Because of its greater tolerance to inclement weather, O. cornuta pollinated apple flowers for longer periods (both daily and seasonally) than other flower visitors.},

However, adults feed on non-prey resources such as pollen from flowers. Heterogeneous landscapes can provide syrphids with a great biodiversity of plants and ensure the existence of food resources. This is particularly important during periods of food scarcity, such as autumn, for syrphid species that spend those periods as adults. Nevertheless, the feeding habits of syrphid adults in resource-scarce agroecosystems are poorly known. In this study, the pollen consumption and preferences of Eupeodes corollae (Fabricius) and Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer) were analyzed in olive groves and surrounding herbaceous and woody patches in the autumns of 2012 and 2013 in northeastern Portugal. The guts were dissected, and the pollen types were identified and compared with the ground cover plants in the studied patches. Both species consumed and selected pollen types from herbaceous and woody vegetation that occurred in different patches, indicating that they flew between patches. These results highlight the importance of conserving heterogeneous agricultural landscapes to guarantee the existence of food resources for beneficial insects during periods of scarcity.},

  abstract  = {To understand the foraging strategy of honeybee colonies, we measured certain temporal and spatial patterns in the foraging activities of a colony living in a temperate deciduous forest. We monitored foraging activities by housing the colony in an observation hive and reading its recruitment dances to map its food source patches. We found that the colony routinely foraged several kilometres from its nest (median 1.7 km, 95% of foraging within 6.0 km), frequently (at least daily) adjusted its distribution of foragers on its patches, and worked relatively few patches each day (mean of 9.7 patches accounted for 90% of each day's forage). These foraging patterns, together with prior studies on the mechanisms of honeybee recruitment communication, indicate that the foraging strategy of a honeybee colony involves surveying the food source patches within a vast area around its nest, pooling the reconnaissance of its many foragers, and using this information to focus its forager force on a few high-quality patches within its foraging area.},

It is, however, unclear how we should interpret these shifts without some sort of a yardstick: a measure that will reflect how much a species should be shifting to match the change in its environment caused by climate change. Here, we assume that the shift in the phenology of a species{\textquoteright} food abundance is, by a first approximation, an appropriate yardstick. We review the few examples that are available, ranging from birds to marine plankton. In almost all of these examples, the phenology of the focal species shifts either too little (five out of 11) or too much (three out of 11) compared to the yardstick. Thus, many species are becoming mistimed due to climate change. We urge researchers with long-term datasets on phenology to link their data with those that may serve as a yardstick, because documentation of the incidence of climate change-induced mistiming is crucial in assessing the impact of global climate change on the natural world.},

The distance between the two flowers and the concentration of nectar rewards were varied. Nine bees were tested, each over several days. Of the three dance variables examined, the number of reversals in the dance per minute (RATE) most often gave the highest and consistently signed correlation coefficients when paired with the mean caloric reward received per flower visit (CALGAIN), the net caloric gain per unit time (NET), and the mean caloric cost to fly to and visit a flower (CALCOST). In general, RATE is positively correlated with CALGAIN (range of positive coefficients, 0.12 to 0.50) and NET (range, 0.15 to 0.40) and negatively correlated with CALCOST (range, -0.01 to -0.28). Additionally, the probability of dancing after foraging is generally positively associated with CALGAIN and negatively associated with CALCOST. The results suggest that caloric gains and costs may be integrated by the bee and output as a measure of ``profitability'' in the form of the round dance. This information may be communicated to potential recruits, although this is not demonstrated.},

Conversely, when rewards are greatest in the topmost flowers they tend to start in the middle of the inflorescence and depart from the top.

The warmest year of the last two centuries in Austria was 1994, 1995 was a normal year, and the summer of 1996 was exceptionally cold. The Investigations were carried out on large, early-flowering individuals (L-plants) and on small, mainly late-flowering individuals (S-plants). In both size classes, the sequence of phenophases varied in response to the contrasting climatic conditions of these years. In 1994, peak flowering In L-plants occurred about one month earlier than in S-plants; in 1995 and 1996, the periods of full bloom overlapped partially and fully for the two size classes, respectively. Detailed analyses of seed development and thermal time revealed that low temperatures during histogenesis led to remarkable delays in the Initiation of seed and fruit development, whereas seed filling and seed maturation were largely Independent of temperature. Self-pollination resulted in high seed sets. Irrespective of weather conditions and dates of flowering. In both size classes, the seed: ovule ratio of mature fruits was about 0.9 and 0.75, in apical and basal positions of the stalks, respectively. The fruit: flower ratios, however, depended on temperature; the ratio was around 0.8 in 1994 and below 0.5 in 1996. In the cool year 1996, fruit development was so slow that in many individuals only the fruits in the apical positions of the stalks matured before the onset of winter conditions.},

  abstract            = {Recent overviews have suggested that the relationship between species richness and productivity (rate of conversion of resources to biomass per unit area per unit time) is unimodal (hump-shaped). Most agree that productivity affects species richness at large scales, but unanimity is less regarding underlying mechanisms. Recent studies have examined the possibility that variation in species richness within communities may influence productivity, leading to an exploration of the relative effect of alterations in species number per se as contrasted to the addition of productive species. Reviews of the literature concerning deserts, boreal forests, tropical forests, lakes, and wetlands lead to the conclusion that extant data are insufficient to conclusively resolve the relationship between diversity and productivity, or that patterns are variable with mechanisms equally varied and complex. A more comprehensive survey of the ecological literature uncovered approximately 200 relationships, of which 30% were unimodal, 26% were positive linear, 12% were negative linear, and 32% were not significant. Categorization of studies with respect to geographic extent, ecological extent, taxonomic hierarchy, or energetic basis of productivity similarly yielded a heterogeneous distribution of relationships. Theoretical and empirical approaches increasingly suggest scale-dependence in the relationship between species richness and productivity; consequently, synthetic understanding may be contingent on explicit considerations of scale in analytical studies of productivity and diversity.},

  abstract  = {Recent observations of changes in some tundra ecosystems appear to be responses to a warming climate. Several experimental studies have shown that tundra plants and ecosystems can respond strongly to environmental change, including warming; however, most studies were limited to a single location and were of short duration and based on a variety of experimental designs. In addition, comparisons among studies are difficult because a variety of techniques have been used to achieve experimental warming and different measurements have been used to assess responses. We used metaanalysis on plant community measurements from standardized warming experiments at 11 locations across the tundra biome involved in the International Tundra Experiment. The passive warming treatment increased plant-level air temperature by {1-3Â°C}, which is in the range of predicted and observed warming for tundra regions. Responses were rapid and detected in whole plant communities after only two growing seasons. Overall, warming increased height and cover of deciduous shrubs and graminoids, decreased cover of mosses and lichens, and decreased species diversity and evenness. These results predict that warming will cause a decline in biodiversity across a wide variety of tundra, at least in the short term. They also provide rigorous experimental evidence that recently observed increases in shrub cover in many tundra regions are in response to climate warming. These changes have important implications for processes and interactions within tundra ecosystems and between tundra and the atmosphere.},

  abstract  = {Using fluorescence microscopy, deposition of pollen on stigmas and pollen tube growth in the gynoecium of Sagittaria potamogetifolia Merr., a monoecious species with an apocarpous gynoecium, were observed. The maximum rate of pollination averaged 83.9 ± 4.7 %, and the number of pollen grains per stigma ranged from zero to 30. Pollen tubes grew through one stigma to the base of the ovary at almost the same speed, but generally only one of the pollen tubes then turned towards the ovule and finally entered the nucellus through the micropyle. The other pollen tubes grew through the ovary base and the receptacle tissue into ovules of adjacent carpels whose stigmas were not pollinated or which had been pollinated later. This phenomenon is termed pollen tube `reallocation’ by the authors. To verify the direct effect of the phenomenon on fruit set, artificial pollination experiments were conducted in which two or more pollen grains were placed onto only one stigma in each gynoecium; frequently more than one fruitlet was obtained from each flower treated. The reallocation of pollen tubes among pistils in the gynoecium could effect fertilization of ovules of unpollinated pistils and lead to an increase in sexual reproduction efficiency. It would, to some extent, also increase pollen tube competition among pistils of the whole gynoecium.},

  abstract  = {We review commonly used population definitions under both the ecological paradigm (which emphasizes demographic cohesion) and the evolutionary paradigm (which emphasizes reproductive cohesion) and find that none are truly operational. We suggest several quantitative criteria that might be used to determine when groups of individuals are different enough to be considered ‘populations’. Units for these criteria are migration rate (m) for the ecological paradigm and migrants per generation (Nm) for the evolutionary paradigm. These criteria are then evaluated by applying analytical methods to simulated genetic data for a finite island model. Under the standard parameter set that includes L = 20 High mutation (microsatellite-like) loci and samples of S = 50 individuals from each of n = 4 subpopulations, power to detect departures from panmixia was very high (~100%; P < 0.001) even with high gene flow (Nm = 25). A new method, comparing the number of correct population assignments with the random expectation, performed as well as a multilocus contingency test and warrants further consideration. Use of Low mutation (allozyme-like) markers reduced power more than did halving S or L. Under the standard parameter set, power to detect restricted gene flow below a certain level X (H0: Nm < X) can also be high, provided that true Nm <= 0.5X. Developing the appropriate test criterion, however, requires assumptions about several key parameters that are difficult to estimate in most natural populations. Methods that cluster individuals without using a priori sampling information detected the true number of populations only under conditions of moderate or low gene flow (Nm <= 5), and power dropped sharply with smaller samples of loci and individuals. A simple algorithm based on a multilocus contingency test of allele frequencies in pairs of samples has high power to detect the true number of populations even with Nm = 25 but requires more rigorous statistical evaluation. The ecological paradigm remains challenging for evaluations using genetic markers, because the transition from demographic dependence to independence occurs in a region of high migration where genetic methods have relatively little power. Some recent theoretical developments and continued advances in computational power provide hope that this situation may change in the future.},

  abstract  = {The papers in this volume discuss projections of climate change impacts upon humans and ecosystems under a global mean temperature rise of 4degreesC above preindustrial levels. Like most studies, tey are mainly single-sector or single-region-based assessments. Even the multi-sector or multi-region approaches generally consider impacts in sectors and regions independently, ignoring interactions. Extreme weather and adaptation processes are often poorly represented and losses of ecosystem services induced by climate change or human adaptation are generally omitted. This paper addresses this gap by reviewing some potential interactions in a 4degreesC world, and also makes a comparison with a 2degreesC world. In a 4degreesC world, major shifts in agricultural land use and increased drought are projected, and an increased human population might increasingly be concentrated in areas remaining wet enough for economic prosperity. Ecosystem services that enable prosperity would be declining, with carbon cycle feedbacks and fire causing forest losses. There is an urgent need for integrated assessments considering the synergy of impacts and limits to adaptation in multiple sectors and regions in a 4degreesC world. By contrast, a 2degreesC world is projected to experience about one-half of the climate change impacts, with concomitantly smaller challenges for adaptation. Ecosystem services, including the carbon sink provided by the Earth{\textquoteright}s forests, would be expected to be largely preserved, with much less potential for interaction processes to increase challenges to adaptation. However, demands for land and water for biofuel cropping could reduce the availability of these resources for agricultural and natural systems. Hence, a whole system approach to mitigation and adaptation, considering interactions, potential human and species migration, allocation of land and water resources and ecosystem services, will be important in either a 2degreesC or a~4degreesC world.},
  comment   = {Essentially 2 paragraphs on pollination changes 

pg. 226:
While many of the world’s staple crops reproduce vegetatively, or via wind
pollination, many others rely on pollinators. Over 80 per cent of the 264 crops
grown in the EU depend on insect pollination [38]. However, few pollinator
distributions have been modelled in relation to climate change. Quantifying
potential risks is difficult because limited information exists on the relationship
between crops, their pollinators and climate change. It is recommended to collect
such information and carry out bioclimatic or ecophysiological modelling of
species, or species groups, identified as the key pollinators in relation to their
crops. Much more severe and more difficult to model are the potential interactions
between wild species and pollinators.

pg. 232
However, [Dynamic Global Vegetation Models] treat ecosystems simply as a functional type, so that impacts
on biodiversity are not adequately assessed, while the bioclimatic envelope
approach is generally applied to one species at a time and interactions between
species are not considered. A few studies examine the combined effects of climate
change on plants and their pollinators [71] or on predators and their prey, or on
how the spread of disease might induce extinction of some species (e.g. [72]).
Attempts by one species to survive a changed climate by moving to higher
latitudes and altitudes might result in that species becoming invasive in the
new environment it has colonized. However, for the majority of species, the
effects of climate change on such interactions have not been considered, and
this is potentially significant in terms of unforeseen disruption to ecosystem
functioning [73].},

This usage distinguishes constancy from fixed preference or labile preference for the most rewarding flower type; I discuss a quantitative constancy index that is insensitive to preference changes. Because a constant visitor avoids flowers with acceptable rewards, the behavior is inefficient unless there are constraints such as an inability to learn quickly or to remember simultaneously how to deal with many flower types. If such constraints are the basis for constancy, it should be most pronounced when flowers in a mixture differ strongly in morphology or color. I observed bees foraging in outdoor flower arrays and found that constancy always increased with increasing differences among flower types; similar results can be gleaned from one other study. The available experimental evidence thus suggests that constancy reflects behavioral constraints.},

  abstract  = {One view of pollination systems is that they tend toward specialization. This view is implicit in many discussions of angiosperm evolution and plant—pollinator coevolution and in the long—standing concept of pollination syndromes. But actual pollination systems often are more generalized and dynamic than these traditions might suggest. To illustrate the range of specialization and generalization in pollinators' use of plants and vice versa, we draw on studies of two floras in the United States, and of members of several plant families and solitary bee genera. We also summarize a recent study of one local flora which suggests that, although the colors of flowers are aggregated in phenotype space, there is no strong association with pollinator types as pollination syndromes would predict. That moderate to substantial generalization often occurs is not surprising on theoretical grounds. Plant generalization is predicted by a simple model as long as temporal and spatial variance in pollinator quality is appreciable, different pollinator species do not fluctuate in unison, and they are similar in their pollination effectiveness. Pollinator generalization is predicted when floral rewards are similar across plant species, travel is costly, constraints of behavior and morphology are minor, and/or pollinator lifespan is long relative to flowering of individual plant species. Recognizing that pollination systems often are generalized has important implications. In ecological predictions of plant reproductive success and population dynamics it is useful to widen the focus beyond flower visitors within the correct" pollination syndrome, and to recognize temporal and spatial fluidity of interactions. Behavioral studies of pollinator foraging choices and information—processing abilities will benefit from understanding the selective advantages of generalization. In studies of floral adaptation, microevolution, and plant speciation one should recognize that selection and gene flow vary in time and space and that the contribution of pollinators to reproductive isolation of plant species may be overstated. In conservation biology, generalized pollination systems imply resilience to linked extinctions, but also the possibility for introduced generalists to displace natives with a net loss of diversity.},

  abstract            = {Seed production of a flower depends both on the quantity of pollen received and on its "quality" as manifested in rates of germination, ovule fertilization, and seed maturation. Disentangling effects of these two factors is complicated by the fact that seed set is a decelerating function of pollen quantity. One potential element of quality is the genetic similarity of pollen donor and recipient. In ten experiments with Delphinium nelsonii, seed set varied with outcrossing distance, a correlate of genetic similarity. Over all experiments, a 10-m distance significantly (P < .02) outperformed shorter and longer distances by 23-33%, suggesting quality differences. To explore this possibility, we fit decelerating negative-exponential regressions to relationships among stigma pollen load, pollen tube number reaching the ovary, and seed set in a subset of experiments having 1-, 10-, and 100-m treatments. Regression parameters suggested that 10-m pollen is most efficient at producing tubes and seeds, and analysis of residuals from pooled regressions (a nonlinear ANCOVA) showed that 10-m residuals were most positive. The latter effect was significant for pollen load-seed set relationships (P = .009, five experimental replicates) and pollen tube-seed set relationships (P = .021, two replicates), but not pollen load-pollen tube relationships (P = .128, three replicates). These results illustrate the utility of nonlinear regression in distinguishing pollen quantity and quality. They reinforce the conclusion that outcrossing distance affects pollen quality in D. nelsonii, and that an "optimal outcrossing distance" between 1 and 100 m maximizes seed set on average in pollinations using one donor per carpel. Insofar as quality differences persist in natural pollen mixtures that arrive on stigmas, outcrossing distance should affect reproductive success through both paternal and maternal sexual functions.},

  abstract            = {Restricted gene flow and localized selection should establish a correlation between physical proximity and genetic similarity in many plant populations. Given this situation, fitness may decline in crosses between nearby plants (inbreeding depression), and in crosses between more widely separated plants ("outbreeding depression") mostly as a result of disruption of local adaptation. It follows that seed set and offspring fitness may be greatest in crosses over an intermediate "optimal outcrossing distance." This prediction was supported for Ipomopsis aggregata, a long-lived herbaceous plant pollinated by hummingbirds. In six replicate pollination experiments, mean seed set per flower was higher with an outcrossing distance of 1-10 m than with selfing or outcrossing over 100 m. A similar pattern appeared in the performance of offspring from experimental crosses grown under natural conditions and censused for a seven-year period. Offspring from 10-m crosses had higher survival, greater chance of flowering, and earlier flowering than those from 1-m or 100-m crosses. As a result, 1-m and 100-m offspring achieved only 47% and 68%, respectively, of the lifetime fitness of 10-m offspring. Offspring fitness also declined with planting distance from the seed parent over a range of 1-30 m, so that adaptation to the maternal environment is a plausible mechanism for outbreeding depression. Censuses in a representative I. aggregata population indicated that the herbaceous vegetation changes over a range of 2-150 m, suggesting that there is spatial variation in selection regimes on a scale commensurate with the observed effects of outbreeding depression and planting distance. We discuss the possibility that differences in seed set might in part reflect maternal mate discrimination and emphasize the desirability of measuring offspring fitness under natural conditions in assessing outcrossing effects.},

  abstract = {Bees are phytophagous insects that exhibit recurrent ecological specializations related to factors generally different from those discussed for other phytophagous insects. Pollen specialists have undergone extensive radiations, and specialization is not a always a derived state. Floral host associations are conserved in some bee lineages. In others, various species specialize on different host plants that are phenotypically similar in presenting predictably abundant floral resources. The nesting of solitary bees in localized areas influences the intensity of interactions with enemies and competitors. Abiotic factors do not always explain the intraspecific variation in the spatial distribution of solitary bees. Foods stored by bees attract many natural enemies, which may shape diverse facets of nesting and foraging behavior. Parasitism has evolved repeatedly in some, but not all, bee lineages. Available evidence suggests that cleptoparasitic lineages are most speciose in temperate zones. Female parasites frequently have a suite of characters that can be described as a masculinized feminine form. The evolution of resource specialization (including parasitism) in bees presents excellent opportunities to investigate phenotypic mechanisms responsible for evolutionary change.},

  abstract  = {From 2000-2003 a range of Farm Scale Evaluation (FSE) trials were established in the UK to assess the effect of the release and management of herbicide tolerant (HT) crops on the abundance and diversity of farmland wildlife compared with their conventionally managed non-GM-equivalents. The objective of this research project was to investigate gene flow within the winter (WOSR) and spring oilseed rape (SOSR) FSE trials and to develop a statistical model for the prediction of cross-pollination frequency that can be used to evaluate current separation distance guidelines. Seed samples were collected from the non-GM half of the trial sites and were tested for evidence of cross-pollination from the GM HT halves using a quantitative PCR assay specific to the HT (bar) gene. Rates of cross-pollination were found to decrease rapidly with increasing distance from the GM source. The quantitative data were subjected to statistical analysis and a two-step model was found to provide the best fit for the data. Significant differences were found between the results for WOSR, SOSR and varietal association (VA) crops. The model predicted that the %GM content (including upper 95% confidence limits) of a sample taken at a distance of 50 m away from the GM source would be 0.04% (0.84%) for WOSR, 0.02% (0.39%) for SOSR, 0.77% (21.72%) for WOSR VA and 0.37% (5.18%) for SOSR VA. The data and models presented here are discussed in the context of necessary separation distances to meet various possible thresholds for adventitious presence of GM in OSR.},

interactions. In theory, interaction networks can be used to predict the sensitivity of species
against co-extinction, but this has rarely been applied to real ecosystems facing variable landuse
impacts. We investigated plant-pollinator networks on 119 grasslands that varied
quantitatively in management regime, yielding 25 401 visits by 741 pollinator species on 166
plant species.
Species-specific plant and pollinator responses to land use were significantly predicted by
the weighted average land-use response of each species’ partners. Moreover, more specialized
pollinators were more vulnerable than generalists. Both predictions are based on the relative
interaction strengths provided by the observed interaction network. Losses in flower and
pollinator diversity were linked, and mutual dependence between plants and pollinators
accelerates the observed parallel declines in response to land-use intensification. Our findings
confirm that ecological networks help to predict natural community responses to disturbance

Results from our studies indicate organismic attributes such as flowering shoot length varies by 30\% between low and {High Arctic} populations and that experimental warming results in significant increases in shoot height at three of four sites. We find that phenological development of Dryas is accelerated under experimentally warmed conditions which corresponds with a lengthening of the growing season in autumn, greater degrees of seed set and a higher likelihood of colonization of bare ground. We also observe that Dryas dominated ecosystems which are exposed to experimental manipulations are capable of exhibiting net carbon sequestration in late autumn, and that Dryas photosynthesis and green leaf biomass is significantly greater under warmer as opposed to ambient temperature conditions. Dryas leaf nitrogen is also significantly lowered under warmer conditions resulting in senescent leaves having a higher {C:N} ratio than those under ambient conditions. Together these findings indicate that Dryas phenology and carbon flux may be altered to the greatest degree in spring and again in autumn by higher summer temperatures and that simultaneously both positive and negative feedback effects may result from changes in plant and ecosystem performance.},

Winds at 45-90° were not considered; those at 90-135° were regarded as neutral winds. Wind affected speed of flight, but much less than if wind speed were simply superimposed on a constant air speed. Regression lines gave ground speeds of 7.5 and 6.5 m./sec. respectively for unloaded and loaded bees, the difference being significant (P<0.001); in neutral winds these speeds were 7.8 and 7.0 m./sec. respectively. At wind speeds above 4 m./sec. bees flew just above the ground instead of at 7.8 m., and thus maintained a fairly constant ground speed. Bees foraging at 420 m. spent less time feeding, and more in the hive (average differences -16 sec., +20 sec.) than bees foraging at 210 m.},

  abstract  = {1. We subjected sound signals pro- duced during the honey-bee waggle dance to a statistical analysis to test whether bees modify their signals as a result of imbibing sugar solutions of different con- centrations, types, or viscosities and to clarify simultaneous relationships between components of dance sounds and some environmental variables. Dependent variables isolated from the sound signal included pulse number, straight- run time, circle-run time, rate of pulse modulation, cycles per pulse, and frequency of sound. Independent (environ- mental) variables recorded included sugar concentration, sugar viscosity and type, light intensity, hive and feeding- station temperatures and humidities, time of day, sun direction and altitude, wind speed and direction, date, and absolute direction of flight. 
2. All variables were first analyzed as a group. The data then were partitioned into classes for further statistical treatment. Analysis of total and partitioned data yielded 9 correlation coefficients for each pair of variables. Of 90 correlation coefficients determined for the total data, 23 were significant at the 1% level and 41 at the 5% level. From our analysis it is clear that environmental factors influenced the signals but that any one significant correlation does not necessarily indicate communication among bees. 
3. An analysis of principal components (a first step in factor analysis) and a full factor analysis, techniques sug- gested earlier by Sokal, Daly, and Rohlf (1961) and applied to data by Sokal and Daly (1961), sorted out which variables of those measured were largely responsible for variation in the data. This method of analyzing data proved to be especially valuable as an aid in sepa- rating spurious correlation from real re- lationships. 
4. Temperature or its related variables account for much of the variance in the data. The slight relationship obtained in a comparison of pulse-rate modulation and sugar concentration can be explained as a relationship between pulse rate and temperature. 
5. The factor analysis of the data led to a critical over-all look at the evidence for communication by means of the waggle dance, an evaluation which revealed basic discrepancies in the dance- language hypothesis. The results of discrete experiments which arose as a consequence of questions raised by the fac- tor analysis are summarized. 

This summary includes the following points: 
a) Bees can be conditioned to visit a site in response to a reinforced stimulus presented in the hive. 
b) One must separate a discussion of the performance of those recruits which have had experience at foraging at a particular food source from those recruits which have not had such experience. 
c) At least some of the complex behavior previously ascribed to communication by dancing may be explained in terms of simple discrimination conditioning. 
d) The efficiency of finding a food source by naive bees recruited by danc- ing is apparently very low. 
e) A repeat of the classic "step" and "fan" experiments of von Frisch and co- workers with more stringent controls yields results not consistent with the dance-language hypothesis. These ex- periments indicate that the original ex- periments lacked necessary controls. 
f) The fact that simple conditioned responses are readily instilled in bees also provides a possible explanation for relo- cation of swarm clusters.},

  abstract  = {Pollination is a vital ecosystem service, which is endangered by the ongoing declines of pollinators. These declines also affect bumblebees (Bombus s), which are important generalist pollinators in agricultural landscapes. Most studies focussing on the conservation of bumblebees have investigated the effects of local flower-rich habitats on bumblebee density and diversity. However, bumblebee densities do not necessarily correlate with the colonies’ reproductive success (i.e. the presence or absence of males and/or queens).
We analysed the effects of landscape-wide availability of mass flowering oilseed rape Brassica napus on the growth and sexual reproduction of Bombus terrestris colonies. Thirty-two young colonies were established and monitored in different resource environments represented by 16 landscapes (circular study areas with 3000 m radius) with large or small amounts of oilseed rape. As an indicator of colony growth, we used weight gain, which was strongly correlated with the numbers of brood cells in the colonies.
The colonies gained significantly more weight in study areas with large amounts of oilseed rape particularly during early colony stages.
Despite early weight gain, the colonies in study areas with large amounts of oilseed rape did not reproduce more successfully. The frequencies of colonies that produced males and/or queens did not differ between the two resource environments.
Synthesis and applications. Early mass flowering oilseed rape has a beneficial effect on colony growth, which however, does not translate into a greater likelihood of colonies producing sexual offspring. This may be due to food plant scarcity later in the colony cycle. Conservation measures should enhance food plant availability in agricultural landscapes, particularly during the most critical phases of the colony cycle: the colony establishment in spring and the reproductive phase in mid- to late summer.},

If bumblebee species possess specific foraging ranges, different spatial resource utilisation patterns might operate as an additional mechanism of coexistence in bumblebee communities. We investigated the effects of the landscape-wide availability of different resources (mass flowering crops and semi-natural habitats) on the local densities of four bumblebee species at 12 spatial scales (landscape sectors with 250--3,000 m radius) to indirectly identify the spatial scales at which the bumblebees perceive their environment. The densities of all bumblebee species were enhanced in landscapes with high proportions of mass flowering crops (mainly oilseed rape). We found the strongest effects for Bombus terrestris agg. and Bombus lapidarius at large spatial scales, implying foraging distances of 3,000 and 2,750 m, respectively. The densities of Bombus pascuorum were most strongly influenced at a medium spatial scale (1,000 m), and of Bombus pratorum (with marginal significance) at a small spatial scale (250 m). The estimated foraging ranges tended to be related to body and colony sizes, indicating that larger species travel over larger distances than smaller species, presumably enabling them to build up larger colonies through a better exploitation of food resources. We conclude that coexistence in bumblebee communities could potentially be mediated by species-specific differences in the spatial resource utilisation patterns, which should be considered in conservation schemes.},

  abstract  = {To counteract the decline of pollinators in Europe, conservation strategies traditionally focus on enhancing the local availability of semi-natural habitats, as supported by the European Union's Common Agriculture Policy. In contrast, we show that densities of bumblebees, an important pollinator group in agroecosystems, were not determined by the proportion of semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes. Instead, bumblebee densities were positively related to the availability of highly rewarding mass flowering crops (i.e. oilseed rape) in the landscape. In addition, mass flowering crops were only effective determinants of bumblebee densities when grown extensively at the landscape scale, but not at smaller local scales. Therefore, future conservation measures should consider the importance of mass flowering crops and the need for management schemes at landscape level to sustain vital pollination services in agroecosystems.},

  abstract  = {Although many studies have examined the phenological mismatches between interacting organisms, few have addressed the potential for mismatches between phenology and seasonal weather conditions. In the Arctic, rapid phenological changes in many taxa are occurring in association with earlier snowmelt. The timing of snowmelt is jointly affected by the size of the late winter snowpack and the temperature during the spring thaw. Increased winter snowpack results in delayed snowmelt, whereas higher air temperatures and faster snowmelt advance the timing of snowmelt. Where interannual variation in snowpack is substantial, changes in the timing of snowmelt can be largely uncoupled from changes in air temperature. Using detailed, long-term data on the flowering phenology of four arctic plant species from Zackenberg, Greenland, we investigate whether there is a phenological component to the temperature conditions experienced prior to and during flowering. In particular, we assess the role of timing of flowering in determining pre-flowering exposure to freezing temperatures and to the temperatures experienced prior to flowering. We then examine the implications of flowering phenology for flower abundance. Earlier snowmelt resulted in greater exposure to freezing conditions, suggesting an increased potential for a mismatch between the timing of flowering and seasonal weather conditions and an increased potential for negative consequences, such as freezing damage. We also found a parabolic relationship between the timing of flowering and the temperature experienced during flowering after taking interannual temperature effects into account. If timing of flowering advances to a cooler period of the growing season, this may moderate the effects of a general warming trend across years. Flower abundance was quadratically associated with the timing of flowering, such that both early and late flowering led to lower flower abundance than did intermediate flowering. Our results indicate that shifting the timing of flowering affects the temperature experienced during flower development and flowering beyond that imposed by interannual variations in climate. We also found that phenological timing may affect flower abundance, and hence, fitness. These findings suggest that plant population responses to future climate change will be shaped not only by extrinsic climate forcing, but also by species' phenological responses.},

Samples were taken also from heath balds and grassy balds and a California coastal redwood forest. Available information on ratios and regressions of forest tree and shrub dimensions were used to estimate stand biomass and net annual production above ground. Mature climax forests of mesic environments below 1,400 m are characterized by: wood basal areas of 50-64 m^2/ha and basal area increments of 0.3-0.6 m^2/ha/yr, stem wood volumes (parabolic estimate) of 750-900 m^3/ha and estimated wood volume increments of 530-590 cm^3/m^2/yr, aboveground biomasses of 500-610 t/ha and aboveground net annual productions of 1,000-1,200 g/m^2, and biomass accumulation ratios of 40-50. These and other stand dimensions decrease along the moisture gradient to xeric sites and decrease toward higher elevations. Above-ground net annual productions of forest heaths of xeric slopes and forests of highest elevations are 420-650 g/m^2. Evergreen spruce-fir forests are more productive than deciduous forests above 1,400 m. Among mesic high-elevation beech and fir forests, production is higher on south slopes than on north slopes. Production and biomass of steady-state forests were estimated from multiple correlations using elevation and weighted-average index of site moisture as independent variables. Apart from some high-elevation stands, production is not significantly correlated with evergreen vs. deciduous foliage or with direction of exposure affecting incident sunlight. When unstable stands are excluded, production and biomass are strongly correlated with each other and with mean tree height and other stand dimensions. A wide range of temperate-zone climax forests of relatively favorable environments have net annual productions above and below ground of 1,200-1,500 g/m^2. Productions of stable closed heath balds are lower, 700-1,200 g/m^2, but productions of heath balds and less productive forests overlap broadly. Production of unstable forests, both successional stands and those opened by removal of large trees, exceeds that of steady-state forests of similar environments. Canopy coverage and light penetration are not strongly correlated with forest production. Light penetration to the herb stratum ranges from 1.4-7.0% of incident sunlight in more open forests and forest heaths to 0.3-0.9% in cove forests. Foliage live/dry ratios decrease along the moisture gradient from mesic to xeric stands--from about 5.0 to 2.8 in shrub clippings, 7.6 to 2.8 in herb clippings. Undergrowth production and biomass are trivial compared with the tree stratum in many forests. Shrub production is generally higher in xeric environments and is 20-145% of tree production in forest heaths. Herb production is higher at the extremes of the moisture gradient (exceeding 3% of total aboveground production in mesic and in open xeric stands) than in intermediate stands (below 1%). Apart from such differences, her and thallophyte biomass and production increase with elevation to maximum values in fir forests of the highest summits.},

Eight small-tree and shrub speices of woodlands and deserts were subjected to dimension analysis by the Brookhaven system. Aboveground biomass decreased along the elevation gradient from 36-79 dry kg/m^2 in fir and Douglas-fir forest to 0.26-0.43 kg/m^2 in the desert grassland and two desert samples. Net aboveground primary productivity similarly decreased from 1,050-1,150 g/m^2@? yr in mesic high-elevation forests to 92-140 g/m^2@? yr in desert grassland and deserts. Both biomass and production show a two-slope relation to elevation (and, probably, to precipitation), with a steeper decrease from the high-elevation forests to the mid-elevation woodlands, and a less steep decrease from dry woodlands through desert grassland into desert. The two groups of communities at higher vs. lower elevations also show different relations of leaf area index and chlorophyll to elevation and to productivity. The two groups may represent different adaptive patterns: surface-limiting, with low productivity in relation to precipitation but high production efficiency in relation to surface in the more arid lower elevations, vs. surface-abundant, with high productivity relative to precipitation based on high community surface area, but lower production efficiency in relation to this area, in the more humid higher elevations. Vascular plant species diversity shows no simple relation to productivity, but decreases from high-elevation fir frests to the pine forests, increases from these to the open woodlands, and decreases from dry woodlands through the desert grassland and mountain slope desert to the lower bajada (creosotebush) desert.},

When females were fed pollen and water only, longevity and fecundity were significantly reduced. Neither variable was affected when females were provided with pollen and 2%(w/v) or 20%(w/v) sugar solution.

Fecundity, but not longevity, was significantly reduced when pollen was restricted. The reduction in fecundity was not correlated with reduced pollen consumption and may have been related to neuroendocrine effects. When sugar or pollen were limited, fecundity showed a weaker relationship with size.

Flight had little effect on longevity or fecundity when sugar and pollen were unrestricted.},

  abstract  = {Landscape ecology and conservation share a common focus on places, but they differ in their perspectives about what is important about those places, and the integration of landscape ecology into conservation is far from complete. I consider four ways in which landscape ecology can contribute to conservation. First, protected areas that are established for conservation are not stand-alone isolates. They exist in the context of broader landscape mosaics, which may encourage or discourage movements of individuals into and out of an area. Second, the landscape surroundings of a preserve may contain threats to the biodiversity within the preserve, many of them consequences of human activities. In combination, these relationships with the surroundings may make the “effective area” of a preserve different from that shown on a map. Third, the scale of an administrative area or of management action may not coincide with the scales of populations, disturbances, or ecological processes, creating challenges to both landscape ecology and conservation. Finally, landscapes encompass people and their activities; sustainability of conservation requires consideration of the tradeoffs between human uses and the biodiversity values of a landscape. I illustrate these four themes with a case study of the management of prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) in the Great Plains of North America, where the tensions between conservation and human land uses are particularly high. Ecologists and conservationists consider prairie dogs as keystone species in these grassland ecosystems and primary targets for conservation, but many private landowners regard them as varmints that consume valuable livestock forage and degrade rangeland condition. Effective conservation of functioning grasslands must include prairie dogs, and this in turn requires that the issues be addressed in terms of the biological, social, and cultural features of entire landscapes. Important as they are, areas protected for conservation cannot by themselves stem the tide of global biodiversity loss. The perspective must be broadened to include the landscapes where people live and work, recognizing the dynamic nature of landscapes and the factors driving land-use change. Landscape ecologists must work together to overcome the cultural differences between their disciplines, and between academic science and conservation practice and management. It can, and must, be done.},

  abstract            = {1. Evidence of conditions being more favourable or less favourable to species of the same genus, as compared with species on different genera (intrageneric versus inter-generic competition), can be found in the relative number of species and genera in small and in large natural communities of animals or plants. 2. It is, however, insufficient to show that the average number of species per genus is smaller in the smaller communities than in the larger as this is a mathematical result of taking a smaller sample from a larger group. It is necessary to show that the proportion of genera to species in the smaller communities is smaller or larger than would have been expected in a randomized sample of the same number of species, selected without reference to generic relationships from the larger fauna or flora. 3. Evidence had previously been brought forward to show that in large groups of animals or plants the number of genera with 1, 2, and with 3 and more species are closely represented by the mathematical `logarithmic series'. New evidence is here given to show that the same order exists in the genera and species of quite small ecological communities. 4. The logarithmic series has several mathematical properties of biological interest, including the possibility of calculating, for any population or sample, a factor known as the `Index of Diversity' which is common to all random samples from a single population. It is a measure of the extent to which the species are grouped into genera, and it is independent of the size of the sample. If the Index of Diversity is high, there are many genera in relation to the number of species; if the Index is low, there are fewer genera in relation to the number of species. 5. It thus becomes possible to compare the Index of Diversity in natural small or simple ecological communities, with that of the larger population from which these have been selected by nature. This has been done for a number of cases, including both animal and plant communities, and in every case from which significant results can be obtained the Index of Diversity in the small community is smaller than that of the larger fauna or flora. 6. The result therefore indicates that there are fewer genera in a small or simple community than would be expected in a sample of the same number of species selected at random--that is, independent of genera relationships--from the larger series. In other words, the evidence brought forward by this method indicates a selection by nature in favour of more than one species in the same genus rather than in favour of single species in different genera.},

  abstract  = {The ability to predict the responses of ecological communities and individual species to human-induced environmental change remains a key issue for ecologists and conservation managers alike. Responses are often variable among species within groups making general predictions difficult. One option is to include ecological trait information that might help to disentangle patterns of response and also provide greater understanding of how particular traits link whole clades to their environment. Although this “trait-guild” approach has been used for single disturbances, the importance of particular traits on general responses to multiple disturbances has not been explored. We used a mixed model analysis of 19 data sets from throughout the world to test the effect of ecological and life-history traits on the responses of bee species to different types of anthropogenic environmental change. These changes included habitat loss, fragmentation, agricultural intensification, pesticides and fire. Individual traits significantly affected bee species responses to different disturbances and several traits were broadly predictive among multiple disturbances. The location of nests - above vs. below ground - significantly affected response to habitat loss, agricultural intensification, tillage regime (within agriculture) and fire. Species that nested above ground were on average more negatively affected by isolation from natural habitat and intensive agricultural land use than were species nesting below ground. In contrast below-ground-nesting species were more negatively affected by tilling than were above-ground nesters. The response of different nesting guilds to fire depended on the time since the burn. Social bee species were more strongly affected by isolation from natural habitat and pesticides than were solitary bee species. Surprisingly, body size did not consistently affect species responses, despite its importance in determining many aspects of individuals’ interaction with their environment. Although synergistic interactions among traits remain to be explored, individual traits can be useful in predicting and understanding responses of related species to global change.},

Few studies, however, have directly assessed the spatiotemporal variation in resource availability that arises from landscape pattern, or its effect on populations and population dynamic parameters. We tested the effect of floral resource availability at the landscape scale on the numbers of worker, male, and queen offspring produced by bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, colonies experimentally placed within complex agricultural-natural landscapes. We quantified flower densities in all land use types at different times of the season and then used these data to calculate spatially explicit estimates of floral resources surrounding each colony. Floral availability strongly correlated with landscape structure, and different regions of the landscape showed distinct seasonal patterns of floral availability. The floral resources available in the landscape surrounding a colony positively affected the number of workers and males it produced. Production was more sensitive to early- than to later-season resources. Floral resources did not significantly affect queen production despite a strong correlation between worker number and queen number among colonies. No landscape produced high floral resources during both the early and late season, and seasonal consistency is likely required for greater queen production. Floral resources are important determinants of colony growth and likely affect the pollination services provided by bumble bees at a landscape scale. Spatiotemporal variation in floral resources across the landscape precludes a simple relationship between resources and reproductive success as measured by queens, but nonetheless likely influences the total abundance of bumble bees in our study region.},

reductions in food plants in many parts of the world, but that other factors such as pathogens may be
having a stronger effect for a few species in some regions (especially for Bombus s. str. in North America).
Evidence so far is that greater susceptibility to land-use change is associated world-wide with small climatic
ranges, range edges, and late-starting colony-development cycles. More evidence is needed on the roles of
pollen specialization, nest sites, hibernation sites, and pesticides. It is still too early to assess the success
of schemes aimed at improving forage in agricultural and conservation areas. However, schemes aimed at
raising public awareness have been very successful. Until proven safe, we recommend that live bumblebees
should not be moved across continents or oceans for commercial pollination.},

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the behavioral, ecological, and physiological determinants of the activity patterns of bees. An activity pattern is the change in levels of a particular activity through time. Bees are an excellent taxon within which to investigate both the issues of constraint and currency. Their physiological constraints are better understood than those of almost any other invertebrate, allowing an unparalleled opportunity to integrate physiology into behavioral ecology. Many bees require elevated body temperatures (Tb) to fly, and hence thermal properties of their environment significantly constrain their activity. However, many species are heterothermic, being able to elevate their Tb endothermically when necessary, which gives some degree of escape from the usual thermal constraints on other entirely ectothermic insects. The chapter discusses the factors structuring activity patterns in a wide range of bees. Observed activity patterns are generated by interactions between properties of the bees themselves (intrinsic factors) and properties of their environment (extrinsic factors). Intrinsic factors include physiological differences between species and between the sexes. Extrinsic factors are the fluctuating properties of the environment, and are either abiotic or biotic.},

Desert bees do not show significant differences in most thermal parameters; mean endothermic warm-up rates are similar to those of temperate species, with no special cooling mechanisms, and normal upper critical temperatures (unlike desert ants and beetles).

2. They show the whole range of possible water balance problems; small species are acutely water-stressed when foraging, but large bees suffer from excessive generation of metabolic water in flight. 
3. Activity patterns are therefore either matinal, crepuscular or bimodal; essentially desert bees avoid heat and adapt to cold desert dawns and dusks. Desert plants must be coevolved to offer appropriate rewards and match the physiological constraints on their pollinators. 
4. Endothermy in bees may have evolved primarily in arid zones, and served as a pre-adaptation for subsequent invasion of cool temperate biomes.},

  abstract  = {Variation in the physical characteristics of the environment should impact the movement energetics of animals. Although cognizance of this may help interpret movement ecology, determination of the landscape-dependent energy expenditure of wild animals is problematic. We used accelerometers in animal-attached tags to derive energy expenditure in 54 free-living imperial cormorants Phalacrocorax atriceps and construct an energy landscape of the area around a breeding colony. Examination of the space use of a further 74 birds over 4 years showed that foraging areas selected varied considerably in distance from the colony and water depth, but were characterized by minimal power requirements compared with other areas in the available landscape. This accords with classic optimal foraging concepts, which state that animals should maximize net energy gain by minimizing costs where possible and show how deriving energy landscapes can help understand how and why animals distribute themselves in space.},

We tested whether the competitive responses of eight species varied with fertility and disturbance in an old field. We also tested whether the competitive effects of vegetation varied with fertility and disturbance in an old field. We also tested whether the competitive effects of vegetation varied with fertility and disturbance. Plots received one of four combinations of nitrogen (added or not) and disturbance (tilled or not) in each of five years. There were 10 replicates of each treatment. In the fifth summer, transplants of eight species comprising annual and perennial forbs and grasses were grown in all four combinations of the N and disturbance treatments. Transplants were grown in subplots with all neighbors, with only roots of neighbors, or with no neighbors. Transplant roots and shoots were harvested after one summer and individual growth rates were determined. Growth rate varied significantly with the interaction among species, competition, and N, suggesting that species differed in their competitive responses and that these differences varied with N availability. Comparisons among competition treatments at each level of N showed six distinct responses in the eight species examined. The competitive effect of neighboring vegetation shifted from roots to shoots as N increased, but decreased in disturbed plots. The total effect of competition increased significantly with neighbor mass in 4 of the 32 examined (eight species in four combinations of N and disturbance). All four cases involved annuals in annual neighborhoods. The results for eight species confirmed earlier single-species diverged in their responses to competition as soil N availability varied.},

Human land use and the loss of native habitats is thought to be an important driver of decline for wild, native pollinators, yet the findings of published studies on this topic have never been
quantitatively synthesized. Here we use meta-analysis to synthesize the literature on how bees, the most important group of pollinators, are affected by human disturbances such as habitat loss, grazing, logging, and agriculture. We obtained 130 effect sizes from 54 published studies recording bee abundance and/or species richness as a function of human disturbance. Both bee abundance and species richness were significantly, negatively affected by disturbance. However, the magnitude of the effects was not large. Furthermore, the only disturbance type showing a significant negative effect, habitat loss and fragmentation, was statistically significant only in systems where very little natural habitat remains. Therefore, it would be premature to draw conclusions about habitat loss having caused global pollinator decline without first assessing the extent to which the existing studies represent the status of global ecosystems. Future pollinator declines seem likely given forecasts of increasing land-use change.},

Determining whether this result holds for real-world ecosystem services has remained elusive, however, largely due to the lack of analytical methods appropriate for large-scale, associational data. Here, we use a novel analytical approach, the Price equation, to partition the contribution to ecosystem services made by species richness, composition and abundance in four large-scale data sets on crop pollination by native bees. We found that abundance fluctuations of dominant species drove ecosystem service delivery, whereas richness changes were relatively unimportant because they primarily involved rare species that contributed little to function. Thus, the mechanism behind our results was the skewed species-abundance distribution. Our finding that a few common species, not species richness, drive ecosystem service delivery could have broad generality given the ubiquity of skewed species-abundance distributions in nature.},

We used crop pollination as a model system, and investigated whether the loss of a domesticated pollinator (the honey bee) could be compensated for by native, wild bee species. We measured pollination provided to watermelon crops at 23 farms in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA, and used a simulation model to separate the pollen provided by honey bees and native bees. Simulation results predict that native bees alone provide sufficient pollination at > 90% of the farms studied. Furthermore, empirical total pollen deposition at flowers was strongly, significantly correlated with native bee visitation but not with honey bee visitation. The honey bee is currently undergoing extensive die-offs because of Colony Collapse Disorder. We predict that in our region native bees will buffer potential declines in agricultural production because of honey bee losses.},

  abstract  = {-Concern about a global decline in wild pollinators has increased interest in how pollinators are affected by human land use, and how this, in turn, affects crop pollination.
-We measured wild bee visitation to four summer vegetable crops, and investigated associations between flower visitation rates and land-use intensity at local and landscape scales. -We studied 29 farms in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA. Over 2 years we recorded >7400 bee visits to crop flowers and identified 54 species of wild bees visiting crops.
-Wild bees were the dominant flower visitors at three of the four crops studied; domesticated honeybees, Apis mellifera L., provided the remainder of visits.
-Ordination of the two best studied crops showed that the wild bee species visiting tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L., were distinct from those visiting watermelon, Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai.
-Crop visitation by wild bees was not associated with organic farming, nor with natural habitat cover at either local or landscape scale.

Synthesis and applications. The extent of crop visitation by wild bees observed in this study is among the highest recorded. In contrast to previous studies of crop visitation by wild bees, we did not find negative effects of conventional farming or natural habitat loss. In our study system, organic and conventional farms differ little in field size, crop diversity and weedy flower diversity, unlike some systems where organic farms have smaller fields with greater crop and weed diversity. Such variables may be more important than organic vs. conventional farming practices. Second, small patches of natural habitat are dispersed throughout our entire study system, and this habitat heterogeneity may support high bee abundance even in landscapes with a low proportion of natural habitat overall. Our findings suggest that agri-environment schemes and similar programmes that work through local habitat restoration should target farms in intensively agricultural (homogeneous) landscapes to gain maximum conservation benefits.},

  abstract  = {Neutral landscape models predict that habitat loss will abruptly disrupt landscape
connectivity. We performed a series of simulation experiments to explore whether
thresholds in landscape connectivity affect movement attributes (path length, net displacement,
and fractal dimension of pathway) within fractal neutral landscapes. We then tested
these assumptions by generating fractal landscape patterns in the field across a range of
habitat abundances (0%, 20%, 50%, and 80% grass) and patchiness (clumped vs. patchy)
and quantified how patch structure affected movement behavior in a generic organism, the
common cricket Acheta domestica (Orthoptera: Gryllidae).
In the simulation experiment, individuals constrained to move only through adjacent
grass cells (neighborhood size 5 4 cells) exhibited abrupt thresholds between 50% and
80% grass cover for all movement parameters in clumped fractal landscapes but exhibited
a linear decline in movement with decreasing habitat in patchy landscapes. Individuals
constrained to move in sand within these same landscapes did not exhibit thresholds in
movement with decreasing sand habitat. The exception is for the fractal dimension of
pathways (a measure of tortuosity) in which a threshold occurred between 50% and 80%
grass (50% and 20% sand) in patchy landscapes. Increasing the scale of movement by
allowing individuals to move through unsuitable habitat (neighborhood size 5 12 cells)
reduced or eliminated any effects of patch structure on movement.
Live crickets can traverse both grass and sand, and thus threshold effects in movement
behavior were generally not evident in the field experiment. Only small crickets (15-25
mm) exhibited a threshold response in net displacement (straight-line distance traversed)
between 50% and 80% grass cover (50% and 20% sand). Crickets did exhibit significant
responses to patch structure, however. Crickets moved faster and with less tortuosity in the
control (0% grass) and less-vegetated (20% grass) plots than in plots with greater habitat
coverage. Crickets used grass cells significantly more (73%) than expected in the 20%
patchy fractal microlandscape; crickets were reluctant to leave isolated cells of grass. Grass
provided cover, but sand facilitated movement. While experimentation at the landscape
scale is generally intractable or impossible, computer simulation and field experiments
founded on neutral landscape models permit initial assessment of how disrupting landscape
connectivity affects movement behavior.},

  abstract  = {(1) We investigated whether excessive work loads will reduce duration of the foraging career in honeybee workers. Such an effect would be crucial to understanding foraging strategies used by nectar-collectors, as analysed in earlier studies. Bees were kept in an observation hive that was regularly checked for the presence and domestic activity of individuals. A random sample of foragers was caught from a feeding dish and individually marked. They were randomly assigned a particular extra weight consisting of small pieces of lead (range 4-48 mg) permanently glued onto the thorax of the workers. The bees were then released and the time until last observation of the animal was recorded, i.e. the duration of the remaining foraging career (CAREER). Observations were grouped into control bees with no extra weight (K), and animals carrying extra weights (average extra weight of groups: W1 = 11.5 mg, W2 = 16.1 mg, W3 = 22.9 mg, W4 = 38.6 mg). The hive entrance was surveyed for 4 h each day to record foraging activities of marked individuals. (2) CAREER varied significantly among treatment groups with 10.8+-1.0 days for the control animals, but 10.7+-0.8 (W1), 10.2+-1.0 (W2), 7.5+-0.8 (W3), and 7.9+-0.6 days in group W4 (H = 11.77, P = 0.02). Life spans were reduced in particular for bees carrying more than c. 20 mg of extra weight (groups W3 and W4). The observations suggested, on the other hand, that compensation for heavy extra weights seemed to occur in group W4, as these animals reduced the number of foraging trips per observation period and activity levels inside the hive. However, similar conclusions emerged when W4 was excluded from the analysis. (3) The findings reported here in conjunction with earlier studies (Schmid-Hempel & Wolf 1988) indicate that only excessive work loads will eventually lead to a reduction in the duration of the foraging career. Moderate variations close to work loads normally adopted by the foragers seem to have little effect. This result vindicates the existence of a survival cost to foraging activity, but suggests a non-trivial dependency.},

(Schmid-Hempel, Kacelnik & Houston, 1985) suggests that the dependence of energetic expenditure during slow manoeuvring flight on the size of the nectar load sets an important physiological constraint to foraging strategies of individuals. In this study, we have now measured rate of oxygen consumption over a range of body masses for single workers of the honey-bee. Body mass was experimentally varied by feeding different amounts of sugar solution to the individuals. Measurements were obtained for bees in free forward flight at 0.5 m s<sup>-1</sup> in a wind tunnel and at an ambient temperature of 32<sup></sup>C. The wind tunnel was part of a differential, constant-pressure, variable-volume respirometer that allowed measurements of partial pressure of oxygen with a precision of 5-10 ppm. Using this system observations on nine different individuals (each tested at a range of body masses) were possible. Rate of oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>, in ml h<sup>-1</sup>) for pooled individuals increased with body mass as VO<sub>2</sub> = 0.514 m<sup>0.629</sup>, where m = body mass in mg. A significant positive correlation was found for seven out of the nine bees, with significant variation among individuals. Further measurements were made for hovering bees (three individuals) with VO<sub>2</sub> = 0.417 m<sup>0.648</sup>. Oxygen consumption in motionless and walking bees was quite variable. With these results, an increase in metabolic expenditure as a function of load (i.e. body mass) carried is demonstrated for the first time for the honey-bee. The findings support the interpretation of honey-bee foraging strategy given by Schmid-Hempel, Kacelnik & Houston (1985) and quantify an important physiological constraint for ecologically important behaviours.},

  abstract = {* Changes in agricultural practice across Europe and North America have been associated with range contractions and a decline in the abundance of wild bees. Concerns at these declines have led to the development of flower-rich agri-environment schemes as a way to enhance bee diversity and abundance. Whilst the effect of these schemes on bumblebee species (Bombus spp.) has been well studied, their impact on the wider bee community is poorly understood.

* We used direct observations of foraging bees and pollen load analysis to quantify the relative contribution that sown flowers (i.e. those included in agri-environment scheme seed mixes) make to the pollen diets of wild solitary bees on Higher Level Stewardship farms (HLS) implementing pollinator-focused schemes and on Entry Level Stewardship farms (ELS) without such schemes in southern England, UK.

* HLS management significantly increased floral abundance, and as the abundance of sown flowers increased, these sown plants were utilized for pollen by a greater proportion of the solitary bee species present. However, the overall proportion of pollen collected from sown plants was low for both direct observations (27.0%) and pollen load analysis (23.3%).

* At most only 25 of the 72 observed species of solitary bee (34.7%) were recorded utilizing sown plants to a meaningful degree. The majority of solitary bee species did not collect pollen from flower species sown for pollinators.

* Total bee species richness was significantly associated with plant species richness, but there was no difference in the total species richness of either bee or flowering plant species between HLS and ELS farms.

* Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the majority of solitary bee species present on farmland in the south-east of England collect most of their pollen from plants that persist unaided in the wider environment, and not from those included in agri-environment schemes focused on pollinators. If diverse bee communities are to be maintained on farmland, existing schemes should contain an increased number of flowering plant species and additional schemes that increase the diversity of flowering plants in complementary habitats should be studied and trialled.},

  abstract   = {Changes in agricultural practice across Europe and North America have been associated with declines in wild bee populations. Bee diet breadth has been associated with sensitivity to agricultural intensification, but much of this analysis has been conducted at the categorical level of generalist or specialist, and it is not clear to what extent the level of generalisation within generalist species is also associated with species persistence. We used pollen load analysis to quantify the pollen diets of wild solitary bees on 19 farms across southern England, UK. A total of 72 species of solitary bees were recorded, but only 31 species were abundant enough to allow for formal diet characterisation. The results broadly conformed to existing literature with the majority of species polylectic and collecting pollen from a wide range of plants. Pollen load analysis consistently identified pollens from more plant species and families from each bee species than direct observation of their foraging behaviour. After rarefaction to standardise pollen load sample sizes, diet breadth was significantly associated with frequency of occurrence, with more generalist bees present on more farms than less generalist bees. Our results show that the majority of bee species present on farmland in reasonable numbers are widely variable in their pollen choices, but that those with the broadest diet were present on the greatest number of farms. Increasing the diversity of plants included in agri-environment schemes may be necessary to provide a wider range of pollen resources in order to support a diverse bee community on farmland.},

  abstract   = {Abstract In order to reverse declines in pollinator populations, numerous agri-environment schemes have been implemented across Europe, predominantly focused on increasing the availability of floral resources. Whilst several studies have investigated how bees and wasps (aculeates) respond to management at the scale of the scheme (i.e. within the flower patch) there has been little assessment of how schemes affect diversity at the farm scale. In the current work we assessed whether farms implementing flower-rich schemes had richer aculeate communities than farms without such habitats. A total of 104 species of bee and 44 species of aculeate wasp were recorded. Farms providing flower-rich habitats had significantly greater floral abundance but there were no differences in the total number of aculeate or flowering plant species recorded compared to farms without these habitats. After accounting for differences in sample size, and contrary to expectations, farms without flower-rich habitats were significantly richer in aculeate and flowering plant species. Bumblebees (Bombus s) and honeybees (Apis mellifera) foraged strongly from sown flowers, but the majority of bee species preferred wild plants that are not included in flower-rich schemes such as Heracleum sphondylium, Hypochaeris radicata and Tripleurospermum inodorum. The creation of pollinator-friendly habitats has not increased the diversity of flowering plants and such schemes will consequently only benefit a limited suite of aculeate species. If diverse aculeate communities are to be retained and restored on farmland, agri-environment schemes that provide foraging and nesting resources for a wider range of pollinator species must be developed.},

  abstract  = {Abstract In order to make agriculture more sustainable it is important to enhance the natural processes supporting crop production, including pollination and pest control. The distance over which these services are delivered into the crop (referred to as spill-over) sets limitations on biodiversity mediated agriculture sustainability. We assess how pest control of aphids on wheat (Rhopalosiphum padi) and pollinator linked yield gain in oilseed rape decline with distance from the crop edge. For natural pest control we also assess how field margin floristic diversity (simple grass vs. species-rich wildflower) affects pest control. We do not consider the impact of field margins on oilseed rape pollination as perennial dominated field margins are not in flower at the time of oilseed rape seed set and so do not act to attract pollinators. Aphid colonies exposed to invertebrate natural enemies went extinct at a faster rate than colonies where they were excluded. The rate of decline in per capita growth rates of aphid colonies was greatest when exposed to natural predators, with this effect being detected up to 50 m into the crop where species-rich field margins were present. While oilseed rape yield gains were correlated with pollinator (bees and flies) visitation rates, there was no evidence that yield gain declined with distance from the crop edge. Possibly this was due to honeybees showing no evidence of declining visitation rates with distance into the crop (over 200 m). This contrast with bumblebees, solitary bees and flies which showed evidence of declining visitation rates with distance from the crop edge. Our results suggests that for a typical arable field (c. 12 ha) surrounded by species rich field margins, 50% of the total area could benefit from enhanced pest control services. Increased yields of oilseed rape due to insect pollinators of c. 0.4 t ha-1 were identified, but there was no evidence that field size would limit the spatial distribution of yields. Our results have implications for integrated crop management world-wide through the use of variable dose rate applications technologies that could be used to target pesticides to field centres and so help support biodiversity mediated ecosystem services.},

  abstract  = {“Primary production” refers to energy fixed by plants. The total amount of energy fixed is usually called “gross production.” A certain fraction of gross production is used in respiration by the plants; the remainder appears as new biomass or “net primary production.” Thus for a single plant or a community of green plants:Net Primary Production = Gross Production - Respiration (of Autotrophs)Similar relationships occur in ecosystems except that the organic matter and respiration of heterotrophs must be included. The increase in total organic matter is “net ecosystem production”; respiration is the total respiration of the green plants (autotrophs) and the animal community and decay organisms (heterotrophs). Gross production is of course identical to that of the plant community. Thus for an ecosystem:Net Ecosystem Production = Gross Production - Respiration (of Autotrophs and Heterotrophs)Study of these attributes of terrestrial ecosystems is difficult, both because of the complex interrelations of the processes involved, and because of the problems of working with systems as large as whole forests. Three approaches are in use: (1) Harvest techniques measure weight increase (and caloric equivalent and chemical composition) of net production. A refinement ot this approach based on “dimension analysis” has made possible important recent advances in the study of forests. Other techniques approach gross production and respiration through measurement of exchange of gases, especially CO2. These include: (2) Enclosure studies, involving measurements of CO2 exchange in plastic enclosures of parts of ecosystems and (3) Flux techniques based on measurement of CO2 levels in the environment. All three approaches are being applied to a forest at Brookhaven National Laboratory to determine the production equation of this ecosystem.Results to date have established general ranges of such parameters of ecosystems as total biomass, total surface area of leaves and of stems and branches, rates of decay of organic matter in soils, rates of production of roots, and rates of photosynthesis and respiration under different environmental conditions. In the Brookhaven forest net primary production is 1124 dry g/m2/yr (with an energy equivalent of 492 cal/cm2/yr), and gross production is about 2550 dry g/m2/yr; the producers or green plants thus respire 56% of their gross production. Net ecosystem production is 422 dry g/m2/yr in this young forest. The ratio of total respiration to gross production is a convenient expression of successional status; a value of 0.82 for the Brookhaven forest indicates that this is a late successional community, but not in steady-state or climax condition (1.0). A leaf surface area of 3.8 m2 per m2 of ground surface intercepts sunlight energy, and the ratio of net primary production to incident visible sunlight energy gives a net efficiency of primary production of 0.0088.These and other functional characteristics of ecosystems are currently important topics of research—involving understanding of communities as biological systems, evaluation of the potential of environments to support life and man's harvest; and understanding of the fundamental meaning and consequences of man's alteration, exploitation, and pollution of ecosystems.},

  abstract            = {The effects of temperature, precipitation and nutrient perturbations, and their interactions, are being assessed on two contrasting {Arctic} ecosystems to simulate impacts of climate change. One, a {High Arctic} polar semi-desert community, is characterised by a sparse, low and aggregated vegetation cover where plant proliferation is by seedlings, whereas the other, a sub-{Arctic} dwarf shrub heath, is characterised by a complete vegetation cover of erect, clonal dwarf shrubs which spread vegetatively. The developmental processes of seed production were shown to be highly sensitive, even within one growing season, to specific environmental perturbations which differed between sites. At the polar semi-desert site, there was a striking effect of the temperature enhancement treatments on phenology and seed-setting of Dryas octopetala ssp. octopetala, with almost no seed-setting occurring in plots experiencing ambient temperatures. By contrast, there were no significant effects of temperature enhancement alone on fruit production of Empetrum hermaphroditum at the sub-Arctic dwarf shrub heath site, although fruit production was significantly influenced by the application of nutrients and/or water. The response of a dominant {High Arctic} dwarf shrub to increased temperature suggests that any climate warming may stimulate seed-set. This could be particularly important in the high Arctic where colonisation can proceed in areas dominated by bare ground and where genetic recombination may be needed to generate tolerance to predicted changes of great magnitude. In the sub-Arctic, however, the closed vegetation is dominated by clonally-proliferating species and recruitment from seedlings is rare. Plant fitness will increase here in response to any increased vegetative growth resulting from higher nutrient availability in warmer organic soils.},

For organisms living in highly structured groups of related individuals, such as colonies of social insects, personalities could also emerge at the group level. However, while numerous recent studies have investigated individual-level personality, the phenomenon of collective personality in animal groups has received little attention. In this paper, we apply the concept of collective personality to colonies of honeybees (Apis mellifera). We document the presence of consistent differences among colonies across a wide range of collective behaviours and demonstrate a link between colony-level personality traits and fitness. The colonies in our study showed consistent behavioural differences in traits such as defensive response, foraging activity and undertaking, and several of these traits were correlated as part of a behavioural syndrome. Furthermore, some of these traits were strongly tied to colony productivity and winter survival. Our results show that the concept of collective personality is applicable to colonies of social insects, and that personality differences among colonies can have important consequences for their long-term survival and reproduction. Applying the concept of personality to close-knit animal groups can provide important insights into the structure of behavioural variability in animal populations and the role that consistent between-group behavioural differences play in the evolution of behaviour.},

Examination of data on species number of angiosperms and of land and freshwater birds on islands worldwide, ranging from Greenland and Spitsbergen to New Guinea and Jamaica, demonstrates that species-energy theory can explain 70 to 80% of the variation in species number on such widely varying islands, and further suggests the existence of regular geographic trends in resource utilization or species-abundance patterns. The concepts embodied in species-energy theory can in principle be used to develop predictions of species' abundances and probabilities of occurrence on an island. Species-energy theory may also provide a unified basis for understanding a broad set of observations of patterns in species diversity.},

In the grass family (Poaceae), which contains all the cereal and major forage crops, SI has been known for half a century to be controlled gametophytically by two multiallelic and independent loci, S and Z. But still none of the gene products for S and Z is known and only limited information on related biochemical responses is available. Here we compare current knowledge of grass SI with that of other well-characterized SI systems and speculate about the relationship between SSI and grass SI. Additionally, we discuss comparative mapping as a tool for the further investigation of grass SI.},

  abstract  = {An increasing number of studies in a wide range of natural systems have investigated how pulses of resource availability influence ecological processes at individual, population, and community levels. Taken together, these studies suggest that some common processes may underlie pulsed resource dynamics in a wide diversity of systems. Developing a common framework of terms and concepts for the study of resource pulses may facilitate greater synthesis among these apparently disparate systems. Here, we propose a general definition of the resource pulse concept, outline some common patterns in the causes and consequences of resource pulses, and suggest a few key questions for future investigations. We define resource pulses as episodes of increased resource availability in space and time that combine low frequency (rarity), large magnitude (intensity), and short duration (brevity), and emphasize the importance of considering resource pulses at spatial and temporal scales relevant to specific resource-consumer interactions. Although resource pulses are uncommon events for consumers in specific systems, our review of the existing literature suggests that pulsed resource dynamics are actually widespread phenomena in nature. Resource pulses often result from climatic and environmental factors, processes of spatiotemporal accumulation and release, outbreak population dynamics, or a combination of these factors. These events can affect life history traits and behavior at the level of individual consumers, numerical responses at the population level, and indirect effects at the community level. Consumers show strategies for utilizing ephemeral resources opportunistically, reducing resource variability by averaging over larger spatial scales, and tolerating extended interpulse periods of reduced resource availability. Resource pulses can also create persistent effects in communities through several mechanisms. We suggest that the study of resource pulses provides opportunities to understand the dynamics of many specific systems, and may also contribute to broader ecological questions at individual, population, and community levels.

  abstract  = {We present a central place foraging model that shows how payoff asymmetries originate in contests for access to resources. The essence of the model is that interference competition at resource points lowers the rate at which foragers can load prey, thereby depressing the rate of food delivery to the central place. We show that interference leads to asymmetric payoffs when contests involve foragers with (i) unequal travel distances between the central place and the contested resource points; (ii) inequalities in the rate of food delivery available from alternative foraging sites; (iii) differences in loading efficiency; or (iv) different abilities to interfere. We use the asymmetries to predict dominance rankings, and the patch exploitation tactics of individual foragers. We also consider the implications of the model for changes in the travel distance ( = area) over which foragers can exclude competitors ( = territoriality) as food density changes. Finally, incorporation of interference permits our model to predict the transition between scramble and contest competition.},

  abstract  = {Measured foraging strategies often cluster around values that maximize the ratio of energy gained over energy spent while foraging (efficiency), rather than values that would maximize the long-term net rate of energy gain (rate). The reasons for this are not understood. This paper focuses on time and energy constraints while foraging to illustrate the relationship between efficiency and rate-maximizing strategies and develops models that provide a simple framework to analyze foraging strategies in two distinct foraging contexts. We assume that while capturing and ingesting food for their own use (which we term feeding), foragers behave so as to maximize the total net daily energetic gain. When gathering food for others or for storage (which we term provisioning), we assume that foragers behave so as to maximize the total daily delivery, subject to meeting their own energetic requirements. In feeding contexts, the behavior maximizing total net daily gain also maximizes efficiency when daily intake is limited by the assimilation capacity. In contrast, when time available to forage sets the limit to gross intake, the behavior maximizing total net daily gain also maximizes rate. In provisioning contexts, when daily delivery is constrained by the energy needed to power self-feeding, maximizing efficiency ensures the highest total daily delivery. When time needed to recoup energetic expenditure limits total delivery, a low self-feeding rate relative to the rate of energy expenditure favors efficient strategies. However, as the rate of self-feeding increases, foraging behavior deviates from efficiency maximization in the direction predicted by rate maximization. Experimental manipulations of the rate of self-feeding in provisioning contexts could be a powerful tool to explore the relationship between rate and efficiency-maximizing behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Clustering of organisms can be a consequence of social behaviour, or of the response of individuals to chemical and physical cues. Environmental variability can also cause clustering: for example, marine turbulence transports plankton and produces chlorophyll concentration patterns in the upper ocean. Even in a homogeneous environment, nonlinear interactions between species can result in spontaneous pattern formation. Here we show that a population of independent, random-walking organisms (`brownian bugs'), reproducing by binary division and dying at constant rates, spontaneously aggregates. Using an individual-based model, we show that clusters form out of spatially homogeneous initial conditions without environmental variability, predator-prey interactions, kinesis or taxis. The clustering mechanism is reproductively driven: birth must always be adjacent to a living organism. This clustering can overwhelm diffusion and create non-poissonian correlations between pairs (parent and offspring) or organisms, leading to the emergence of patterns.},

The average nectar production per flower was 0.12-0.21 mg at Fácánkert and 0.08-0.15 mg at
Kerekharaszt. The refraction values were 44.8-59.0% and 45.7-61.3%. Honey bees visited the
fields all day, even in the hot midday hours. From the beginning of the year, the precipitation
was less and the temperature was higher at Kerekharaszt, thus, the nectar production was lower
but more concentrated at this site.
In the previous years in Hungary very low sunflower nectar collection of honey bees and
honey yield was observed. However, the current results show that it did not directly relate to the
introduction of new sunflower hybrids.},

We developed several statistical models with paired climatic variables in order to investigate their relationships to terrestrial NPP. A reference data set of 3023 NPP field observations was compiled for calibration and parameter optimization. In addition to annual mean temperature and precipitation, as in the Miami Model, we chose more ecologically relevant climatic variables including growing degree-days, a soil moisture stress index, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Calculated annual global NPP ranged from 36 to 74 Pg-C yr-1, comparable with previous studies. Comparisons of geographic patterns of NPP were made using biome and latitudinal averages.},

  abstract  = {Agricultural ecosystems are actively managed by humans to optimize the provision of food, fiber, and fuel. These ecosystem services from agriculture, classified as provisioning services by the recent Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, depend in turn upon a web of supporting and regulating services as inputs to production (e.g., soil fertility and pollination). Agriculture also receives ecosystem dis-services that reduce productivity or increase production costs (e.g., herbivory and competition for water and nutrients by undesired species). The flows of these services and dis-services directly depend on how agricultural ecosystems are managed and upon the diversity, composition, and functioning of remaining natural ecosystems in the landscape. Managing agricultural landscapes to provide sufficient supporting and regulating ecosystem services and fewer dis-services will require research that is policy-relevant, multidisciplinary and collaborative. This paper focuses on how ecosystem services contribute to agricultural productivity and how ecosystem dis-services detract from it. We first describe the major services and dis-services as well as their key mediators. We then explore the importance of scale and economic externalities for the management of ecosystem service provision to agriculture. Finally, we discuss outstanding issues in regard to improving the management of ecosystem services and dis-services to agriculture.},

Aims: Plant-pollinator interactions between an {Alpine} plant Codonopsis convolvulacea and its main pollinator, a bee (Andrena sp.) were characterised.
Methods: We recorded the floral biology and floral visitors in three populations of Codonopsis. Pollination treatments were conducted to evaluate the importance of insect visitors.
Results: The bee was the only visitor to two populations, and the main visitor to a third population. Females visited flowers to collect pollen, while males had a multi-faceted relationship with flowers. Nectar was the food resource of males. When the air temperature was <18 °C, they slept on flowers. During the day flowers were bowl-shaped solar collectors (1-3 °C warmer than the ambient air), and flowers were closed at night. Copulation was occasionally observed on flowers. Although flowers lasted 2 days and males were active for 3 h per day, the high visiting frequency (19.8 per flower per hour) guaranteed pollination of each flower.
Conclusions: We suggest that the combination of multiple rewards protect males from cold and unstable weather conditions and encourage them to visit more flowers, and that the specialised pollination system is promoted by the harsh {Alpine} environment.},

Canola fields in southern Alberta were sampled for managed and wild bees, and landscape within a 3 km radius was classified. Abundance and diversity of wild bees, as well as pollen deposition in canola varied positively with the area of adjacent semi-natural habitat. Yet the effects of managed bees and landscape context were found to interact such that abundance of wild bees in landscapes with more semi-natural land declined more strongly over time with increased abundance of managed bees. Canola crops in more natural landscapes may have enhanced yields, but also greater impacts on wild-bee assemblages where managed bees are employed.},

However, whether Ca-induced declines in nutritional quality are also occurring for pollinator food sources is unknown. Flowering late in the season, goldenrod (Solidago spp.) pollen is a widely available autumnal food source commonly acknowledged by apiarists to be essential to native bee (e.g. Bombus spp.) and honeybee (Apis mellifera) health and winter survival. Using floral collections obtained from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, we quantified Ca-induced temporal changes in pollen protein concentration of Canada goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), the most widespread Solidago taxon, from hundreds of samples collected throughout the USA and southern Canada over the period 1842{\textendash}2014 (i.e. a Ca from approx. 280 to 398 ppm). In addition, we conducted a 2 year in situ trial of S. canadensis populations grown along a continuous Ca gradient from approximately 280 to 500 ppm. The historical data indicated a strong significant correlation between recent increases in Ca and reductions in pollen protein concentration (r2 = 0.81). Experimental data confirmed this decrease in pollen protein concentration, and indicated that it would be ongoing as Ca continues to rise in the near term, i.e. to 500 ppm (r2 = 0.88). While additional data are needed to quantify the subsequent effects of reduced protein concentration for Canada goldenrod on bee health and population stability, these results are the first to indicate that increasing Ca can reduce protein content of a floral pollen source widely used by North American bees.},

  abstract  = {1. Solitary bees are central place foragers returning to their nests several times a day with pollen and nectar to provision their brood cells. They are especially susceptible to landscape changes that lead to an increased spatial separation of suitable nesting sites and flower rich host plant stands. While knowledge of bee foraging ranges is currently growing, quantitative data on the costs of foraging flights are very scarce, although such data are crucial to understand bee population dynamics.
2. In this study, the impact of increased foraging distance on the duration of foraging bouts and on the number of brood cells provisioned per time unit was experimentally quantified in the two pollen specialist solitary bee species Hoplitis adunca and Chelostoma rapunculi. Females nesting at different sites foraged under the same environmental conditions on a single large and movable flowering host plant patch in an otherwise host plant free landscape.
3. The number of brood cells provisioned per time unit by H. adunca was found to decrease by 23%, 31% and 26% with an increase in the foraging distance by 150, 200 and 300 m, respectively. The number of brood cells provisioned by C. rapunculi decreased by 46% and 36% with an increase in the foraging distance by 500 and 600 m, respectively.
4. Contrary to expectation, a widely scattered arrangement of host plants did not result in longer mean duration of a foraging bout in H. adunca compared to a highly aggregated arrangement, which might be due to a reduced flight directionality combined with a high rate of revisitation of already depleted flowers in the aggregated plant arrangement or by a stronger competition and disturbance by other flower visitors.
5. The results of this study clearly indicate that a close neighbourhood of suitable nesting and foraging habitats is crucial for population persistence and thus conservation of endangered solitary bee species.},

  abstract  = {To preserve populations of endangered bee species, sound knowledge of their maximum foraging distance between nest and host plants is crucial. Previous investigations predicted maximum foraging distances of 100-200m for small bee species and up to 1100m for very large species based on mainly indirect methods. The present study applied a new and direct approach to experimentally investigate maximum foraging distances in solitary bees. One endangered and two common species of different body sizes, all of which restrict pollen foraging to a single plant genus, were established in a landscape lacking their specific host plants. Females were forced to collect pollen on potted host plants that were successively placed in increasing distance from fixed nesting stands. The maximum foraging distance recorded for the small Hylaeus punctulatissimus was 1100m, for the medium sized Chelostoma rapunculi 1275m and for the large Hoplitis adunca 1400m, indicating that maximum foraging distances at species level have been underestimated. However, the capability to use resources on such a large spatial scale applied only to a small percentage of individuals as 50% of the females of H. punctulatissimus and H. adunca did not forage at distances longer than 100-225m and 300m, respectively. This finding suggests that a close neighbourhood of nesting and foraging habitat within few hundred meters is crucial to maintain populations of these species, and that threshold distances at which half of the population discontinues foraging are a more meaningful parameter for conservation practice than the species specific maximum foraging distances.},

  abstract  = {1. While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed.
2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake.
3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations.
4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

  abstract  = {Community ecology is tasked with the considerable challenge of predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging ecosystems. It requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal scales.
Synthesis
Although species interactions are the backbone of ecological communities, we have little insights on how (and why) they vary through space and time. In this article, we build on existing empirical literature to show that the same species may happen to interact in different ways when their local abundances vary, their trait distribution changes, or when the environment affects either of these factors. We discuss how these findings can be integrated in existing frameworks for the analysis and simulation of species interactions.},

  abstract  = {Warming experiments are increasingly relied on to estimate plant responses to global climate change. For experiments to provide meaningful predictions of future responses, they should reflect the empirical record of responses to temperature variability and recent warming, including advances in the timing of flowering and leafing. We compared phenology (the timing of recurring life history events) in observational studies and warming experiments spanning four continents and 1,634 plant species using a common measure of temperature sensitivity (change in days per degree Celsius). We show that warming experiments underpredict advances in the timing of flowering and leafing by 8.5-fold and 4.0-fold, respectively, compared with long-term observations. For species that were common to both study types, the experimental results did not match the observational data in sign or magnitude. The observational data also showed that species that flower earliest in the spring have the highest temperature sensitivities, but this trend was not reflected in the experimental data. These significant mismatches seem to be unrelated to the study length or to the degree of manipulated warming in experiments. The discrepancy between experiments and observations, however, could arise from complex interactions among multiple drivers in the observational data, or it could arise from remediable artefacts in the experiments that result in lower irradiance and drier soils, thus dampening the phenological responses to manipulated warming. Our results introduce uncertainty into ecosystem models that are informed solely by experiments and suggest that responses to climate change that are predicted using such models should be re-evaluated.},

However, it is unclear which mechanisms give rise to these network properties. Phenology seems important, because it shapes the topology of mutualistic networks, but its effects on the dynamics of mutualistic networks have scarcely been studied. Here, we study these effects with a general dynamical model of mutualistic and competitive interactions where the interaction strength depends on the temporal overlap between species resulting from their phenologies. We find a negative complexity–stability relationship, where phenologies maximising mutualistic interactions and minimising intraguild competitive interactions generate speciose, nested and poorly connected networks with moderate asymmetry and low resilience. Moreover, lengthening the season increases diversity and resilience. This highlights the fragility of real mutualistic communities with short seasons (e.g. Arctic environments) to drastic environmental changes.},

  abstract  = {Mutualisms (cooperative interactions between species) have had a central role in the generation and maintenance of life on earth. Insects and plants are involved in diverse forms of mutualism. Here we review evolutionary features of three prominent insect–plant mutualisms: pollination, protection and seed dispersal. We focus on addressing five central phenomena: evolutionary origins and maintenance of mutualism; the evolution of mutualistic traits; the evolution of specialization and generalization; coevolutionary processes; and the existence of cheating. Several features uniting very diverse insect–plant mutualisms are identified and their evolutionary implications are discussed: the involvement of one mobile and one sedentary partner; natural selection on plant rewards; the existence of a continuum from specialization to generalization; and the ubiquity of cheating, particularly on the part of insects. Plant–insect mutualisms have apparently both arisen and been lost repeatedly. Many adaptive hypotheses have been proposed to explain these transitions, and it is unlikely that any one of them dominates across interactions differing so widely in natural history. Evolutionary theory has a potentially important, but as yet largely unfilled, role to play in explaining the origins, maintenance, breakdown and evolution of insect–plant mutualisms.},

This study assessed how successional changes of the vegetation influenced the composition of the flower-visiting insect assemblages of two plant species, Leucanthemopsis alpina (L.) Heyw. and Saxifraga bryoides L., selected as the only two insect-pollinated species occurring along the whole succession. In addition, we investigated the links between reproductive output of these plants and pollinator abundance through experimental exclusion of pollinators. Plant community structure changed along the succession, affecting the distribution and the abundance of insects via idiosyncratic responses of different insect functional groups. L. alpina interacted with ubiquitously distributed pollinators, while S. bryoides pollinators were positively associated with insect-pollinated plant species density and S. bryoides abundance. With succession proceeding, insect assemblages became more functionally diverse, with the abundance of parasitoids, predators and opportunists positively related to an increase in plant cover and diversity. The reproductive output of both plant species varied among successional stages. Contrary to our expectation, the obligate insect-pollinated L. alpina showed a reproductive output rather independent from pollinator abundance, while the reproductive output of the self-fertile S. bryoides seemed linked to pollinator abundance. Observing ecological interactions and using functional traits, we provided a mechanistic understanding of community assembly processes along a successional gradient. Plant community diversity and cover likely influenced insect community assembly through bottom-up effects. In turn, pollinators regulate plant reproductive output through top-down control. We emphasise that dynamics of alpine plant and insect communities may be structured by biotic interactions and feedback processes, rather than only be influenced by harsh abiotic conditions and stochastic events.},

  abstract  = {A food web customarily describes the qualitative feeding relationships in a community. Descriptors have been used to extract ecologically meaningful information from such data, e.g., the proportion of top species (the proportion of taxa without consumers) or vulnerability (the average number of consumers per taxon). Analyses of collections of food webs based on these properties have revealed regularities that fostered the formulation of models of food-web structure. However, it has been shown that most of these qualitative descriptors are highly sensitive to the varying levels of sampling effort used to document a food web. The principal problem is that webs described extensively include trophic links of highly uneven magnitude, with typically few strong/important links and a wealth of weak ones; with qualitative descriptors, the same weight is given to all trophic interactions. To overcome this problem, food webs should be described and analyzed quantitatively. Consequently, we propose here a suite of food-web descriptors, which are built on information-theory indices and take the magnitude of the trophic interactions into account. We define descriptors having a similar meaning as the classical qualitative indices. Two versions of each quantitative descriptor are proposed, one giving the same weight to each taxon, and one weighting each taxon by the total amount of its incoming and outgoing biomass flows. We use a published quantitative food web to exemplify the computation of the new descriptors, and discuss their potential and limitations.},

Path analytical techniques based on maximum likelihood currently used in ecology are rarely adequate for ecological data, which are often sparse, multi-level, and may contain nonlinear relationships as well as nonnormal response data such as counts or proportion data. Here I introduce a more flexible approach in the form of the joint application of hierarchical Bayes, Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, Shipley's d-sep test, and the potential outcomes framework to fit path models as well as to decompose and estimate effects. An example based on the direct and indirect interactions between ants, two insect herbivores, and a plant species demonstrates the implementation of these techniques, using freely available software.},

  abstract  = {* Pollinating insects provide crucial and economically important ecosystem services to crops and wild plants, but pollinators, particularly bees, are globally declining as a result of various driving factors, including the prevalent use of pesticides for crop protection. Sublethal pesticide exposure negatively impacts numerous pollinator life-history traits, but its influence on reproductive success remains largely unknown. Such information is pivotal, however, to our understanding of the long-term effects on population dynamics.

* We investigated the influence of field-realistic trace residues of the routinely used neonicotinoid insecticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin in nectar substitutes on the entire life-time fitness performance of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis.
 
* We show that chronic, dietary neonicotinoid exposure has severe detrimental effects on solitary bee reproductive output. Neonicotinoids did not affect adult bee mortality; however, monitoring of fully controlled experimental populations revealed that sublethal exposure resulted in almost 50% reduced total offspring production and a significantly male-biased offspring sex ratio.
 
* Our data add to the accumulating evidence indicating that sublethal neonicotinoid effects on non-Apis pollinators are expressed most strongly in a rather complex, fitness-related context. Consequently, to fully mitigate long-term impacts on pollinator population dynamics, present pesticide risk assessments need to be expanded to include whole life-cycle fitness estimates, as demonstrated in the present study using O. bicornis as a model.},

The Prairies Ecozone thus represents one of the most diverse and important areas supporting bee diversity in the country, with 23% of the bee species listed not found anywhere else in Canada, a value similar to that of the tallgrass savanna of the Mixedwood Plains Ecozone (southern Ontario and Québec) and only surpassed by that of the bunchgrass/sagebrush grasslands of the Western Interior Basin Ecozone (south central British Columbia) with respect to endemism. However, the Canadian Prairies support a higher proportion of bee species with dietary specialization; over half of these are oligoleges of the Asteraceae. Over 70% of the native prairie grasslands were lost before 1990. Therefore, it is likely that many of the endemic floral specialists have also become much less common, though little baseline data exist for rigorous comparison. Much of the Canadian Prairies have not been surveyed extensively for bees, and several new records are reported here. A full taxonomic review of the bees of the prairie grasslands is presented, including bionomic summaries.},

Managed honeybees could spillover after the blooming of MFCs into nearby natural habitats, especially if hive numbers are associated with the cover of MFCs at the landscape scale.

We assessed this ‘MFC-beekeeping’ association and honeybee spillover into woodland patches in 17 fragmented landscapes in SW Spain with contrasting cover of orange groves as MFC. Hive densities were almost four times greater in landscapes with high cover of orange groves and, after the orange-tree bloom, mean honeybee densities were eight times higher in woodland patches within these landscapes, as compared to landscapes with no/low cover. Seemingly, this spillover was resource-mediated since it mirrored the temporal changes in flower cover at habitat and landscape scales. Our study demonstrates for the first time a consistent spillover of managed honeybees from a MFC into nearby natural habitats. These findings are a warning about the potential detrimental effects of magnified honeybee densities on local fauna and flora, especially on wild bees.},

  abstract  = {Ecological intensification advocates the harnessing of regulating and supporting ecosystem services to promote more sustainable food production, and this relies on effective management of non-cropped habitats. Hedgerows are an important component of the landscape in many farming systems across the world, management of which provides a potential mechanism to enhance ecological intensification. Here we investigate the value of hedgerows in Southern England as a source of functionally important taxa, and how hedgerow quality and local landscape composition impact on their potential contribution to sustainable agriculture in arable landscapes. We show that hedgerows are a source habitat for many natural enemies which spill over into neighbouring fields, and that hedgerows provide a valuable forage resource and corridor for movement of pollinators. Hedgerow quality affects these benefits and continuous unbroken hedgerows, with a high diversity of woody species, are more valuable for the provision of bumblebees and Linyphiid spiders, while the presence of trees within the hedgerow supports Lycosid spiders. Floral resources, beyond the woody hedgerow species themselves, are also a key forage resource for hoverflies. The impact of these hedgerows on invertebrate abundance is moderated by local landscape, and hedgerows are a more valuable forage resource for pollinators in more intensely managed landscapes. Our study shows that in order to support abundant and a broad range of natural enemies and pollinators in agricultural landscapes, both hedgerows and local semi-natural habitats need to be protected and managed. The benefit of hedgerows, as a habitat for functionally important taxa depends on hedgerow quality and management practices such as avoiding gaps, high hedge species diversity and maintaining an abundant understory of plants, can improve their value for ecological intensification.},

  abstract  = {Bees are generally regarded as beneficial insects for their role in pollination, and in the case of the honeybee Apis mellifera, for production of honey. As a result several bee species have been introduced to countries far beyond their home range, including A. mellifera, bumblebees (Bombus sp.), the alfalfa leafcutter bee Megachile rotundata, and various other solitary species. Possible negative consequences of these introductions include: competition with native pollinators for floral resources; competition for nest sites; co-introduction of natural enemies, particularly pathogens that may infect native organisms; pollination of exotic weeds; and disruption of pollination of native plants. For most exotic bee species little or nothing is known of these possible effects. Research to date has focused mainly on A. mellifera, and has largely been concerned with detecting competition with native flower visitors. Considerable circumstantial evidence has accrued that competition does occur, but no experiment has clearly demonstrated long-term reductions in populations of native organisms. Most researchers agree that this probably reflects the difficulty of carrying out convincing studies of competition between such mobile organisms, rather than a genuine absence of competitive effects. Effects on seed set of exotic weeds are easier to demonstrate. Exotic bees often exhibit marked preferences for visiting flowers of exotic plants. For example, in Australia and New Zealand many weeds from Europe are now visited by European honeybees and bumblebees. Introduced bees are primary pollinators of a number of serious weeds. Negative impacts of exotic bees need to be carefully assessed before further introductions are carried out.},

The explicit and implicit aims of creating ecological focus areas (EFAs) and implementing greening measures in European agro-ecosystems include the promotion of regulatory ecosystem services (ES) to sustain crop production in conventional cropping systems. However, the extent to which these goals are achieved with current policy measures remains poorly explored.
2. We measured insect-mediated pollination and natural pest control service provisioning in 18 winter oilseed rape fields as a function of the independent and interactive effects of local EFA establishment - sown wildflower strips and hedgerows - and landscape-scale greening measures within a 1 km radius around focal fields and quantified their contribution to crop yield.
3. Insect pollination potential and pest predation increased on average by 10 and 13%, respectively, when landscape-scale greening measures share was increased from 6 to 26%. For pollination, the increase was stronger in fields adjoining an EFA (14%) than in fields without adjacent EFA (7%).
4. Agricultural management practices were the main drivers of crop yield. Neither insect pollination potential or natural pest control (pest predation & parasitism) nor adjacent EFAs and landscape-scale greening significantly affected crop yield in addition to agricultural management.
5. Synthesis and applications. Local establishment of perennial, species-rich wildflower strips and hedgerows, combined with landscape-scale greening measures in agricultural landscapes, can promote multiple ecosystem services (ES) in conventional production systems. Benefits may be maximized when local and landscape measures are combined. However, enhanced pollination and natural pest regulation seem to contribute relatively little to final crop yield compared to local agricultural management practices in the high-input conventional production system studied. Further research is needed to better understand how to improve the effectiveness of ecological focus areas and other greening measures in promoting regulatory ES. Potential improvements include minimising trade-offs while promoting synergies between ES provision, food production and biodiversity conservation.},

  abstract  = {Conservation biology can profit greatly from incorporating a phylogenetic perspective into analyses of patterns and drivers of species extinction risk. We applied such an approach to analyse patterns of bumblebee (Bombus) decline. We assembled a database representing approximately 43\% of the circa 260 globally known species, which included species extinction risk assessments following the International Union fo Conservation of Nature Red List categories and criteria, and information on species traits presumably associated with bumblebee decline. We quantified the strength of phylogenetic signal in decline, range size, tongue length and parasite presence. Overall, about one-third of the assessed bumblebees are declining and declining species are not randomly distributed across the Bombus phylogeny. Susceptible species were over-represented in the subgenus Thoracobombus (approx. 64\%) and under-represented in the subgenus Pyrobombus (approx. 6\%). Phylogenetic logistic regressions revealed that species with small geographical ranges and those in which none of three internal parasites were reported (i.e. Crithidia bombi, Nosema spp. or Locustacarus buchneri) were particularly vulnerable. Bumblebee evolutionary history will be deeply eroded if most species from threatened clades, particularly those stemming from basal nodes, become finally extinct. The habitat of species with restricted distribution should be protected and the importance of pathogen tolerance/resistance as mechanisms to deal with pathogens needs urgent research.},

  abstract  = {Value estimates of ecosystem goods and services are useful to justify the allocation of resources towards conservation, but inconclusive estimates risk unsustainable resource allocations. Here we present replacement costs as a more accurate value estimate of insect pollination as an ecosystem service, although this method could also be applied to other services. The importance of insect pollination to agriculture is unequivocal. However, whether this service is largely provided by wild pollinators (genuine ecosystem service) or managed pollinators (commercial service), and which of these requires immediate action amidst reports of pollinator decline, remains contested. If crop pollination is used to argue for biodiversity conservation, clear distinction should be made between values of managed- and wild pollination services. Current methods either under-estimate or over-estimate the pollination service value, and make use of criticised general insect and managed pollinator dependence factors. We apply the theoretical concept of ascribing a value to a service by calculating the cost to replace it, as a novel way of valuing wild and managed pollination services. Adjusted insect and managed pollinator dependence factors were used to estimate the cost of replacing insect- and managed pollination services for the Western Cape deciduous fruit industry of South Africa. Using pollen dusting and hand pollination as suitable replacements, we value pollination services significantly higher than current market prices for commercial pollination, although lower than traditional proportional estimates. The complexity associated with inclusive value estimation of pollination services required several defendable assumptions, but made estimates more inclusive than previous attempts. Consequently this study provides the basis for continued improvement in context specific pollination service value estimates.},

  abstract  = {In the US, the cultivated area (hectares) and production (tonnes) of crops that require or benefit from insect pollination (directly dependent crops: apples, almonds, blueberries, cucurbits, etc.) increased from 1992, the first year in this study, through 1999 and continued near those levels through 2009; aggregate yield (tonnes/hectare) remained unchanged. The value of directly dependent crops attributed to all insect pollination (2009 USD) decreased from $14.29 billion in 1996, the first year for value data in this study, to $10.69 billion in 2001, but increased thereafter, reaching $15.12 billion by 2009. The values attributed to honey bees and non-Apis pollinators followed similar patterns, reaching $11.68 billion and $3.44 billion, respectively, by 2009. The cultivated area of crops grown from seeds resulting from insect pollination (indirectly dependent crops: legume hays, carrots, onions, etc.) was stable from 1992 through 1999, but has since declined. Production of those crops also declined, albeit not as rapidly as the decline in cultivated area; this asymmetry was due to increases in aggregate yield. The value of indirectly dependent crops attributed to insect pollination declined from $15.45 billion in 1996 to $12.00 billion in 2004, but has since trended upward. The value of indirectly dependent crops attributed to honey bees and non-Apis pollinators, exclusive of alfalfa leafcutter bees, has declined since 1996 to $5.39 billion and $1.15 billion, respectively in 2009. The value of alfalfa hay attributed to alfalfa leafcutter bees ranged between $4.99 and $7.04 billion. Trend analysis demonstrates that US producers have a continued and significant need for insect pollinators and that a diminution in managed or wild pollinator populations could seriously threaten the continued production of insect pollinated crops and crops grown from seeds resulting from insect pollination.},

Despite this ecosystem service value, adoption of field border plantings, such as hedgerows, on large-scale mono-cropped farms is minimal. With profits primarily driving agricultural production, a major challenge affecting hedgerow plantings is linked to establishment costs and the lack of clear economic benefits on the restoration investment. Our study documented that hedgerows are economically viable to growers by enhancing beneficial insects and natural pest control and pollination on farms. With pest control alone, our model shows that it would take 16 yr to break even from insecticide savings on the US$4,000 cost of a typical 300-m hedgerow field edge planting. By adding in pollination benefits by native bees, where honey bees ( Apis mellifera L.) may be limiting, the return time is reduced to 7 yr. USDA cost share programs allow for a quicker return on a hedgerow investment. Our study shows that over time, small-scale restoration can be profitable, helping to overcome the barrier of cost associated with field edge habitat restoration on farms.},

  abstract  = {Current national and global scale monetary valuation of pollination services do not accurately estimate the contribution of wild pollinators to agricultural production. First, ecosystem (wild) pollination services remain largely bundled with those of managed pollinators. This problem is compounded by the fact that the dependency of crops on pollination, a key parameter used in current valuations, does not reflect variation in pollinator density, crop cultivars and growing conditions that exist in practice. Over half of the €153 billion of estimated global pollination service value in 2005 is based on estimates of pollinator dependency from crops with fewer than three field studies that measure actual levels of pollinator activity and corresponding fruit set. The resulting uncertainty may be most distorting when applied to widely-planted intensive oilseed crops. Furthermore, current valuations are underpinned by simplistic assumptions regarding the likelihood of pollinator decline and the impact on agricultural prices. Although efforts to motivate wild pollinator protection through their ecosystem service value remain highly circumscribed by conceptual and empirical limitations, we identify the need to go beyond technical solutions and develop a critical framework that could account for why pollinator conservation has come to be predominantly justified in these terms to begin with.},

The benefits of this approach are expected to differ between pollinator groups, because of fundamental differences in their ecology.2.?We studied the responses of two pollinator groups, bumblebees and diurnal Lepidoptera (butterflies and diurnal moths), to the vegetation succession in experimental set-aside during six consecutive years. The pollinators were monitored in 24 large treatment plots (50 × 50 m), sown with three different seed mixtures (competitive and two alternatives) and unmanaged or managed by mowing, and on 10 surrounding field margins.3.?The responses of the two pollinator groups to vegetation succession were distinctly different. Bumblebees showed a very strong positive response to the diverse seed mixture with abundant floral resources, and their abundance peaked in the first year. The species richness and abundance of Lepidoptera were increased gradually, suggesting differential colonization speeds of species and a gradual establishment of populations. Lepidopteran abundance reached the level of the field margins in 3 years, whereas the corresponding species richness level was not reached. The benefits of the alternative seed mixtures were less pronounced in Lepidoptera than in bumblebees. No effects of the mowing treatment on either species group were detected.4.?Within both pollinator groups, the response to vegetation succession was associated with species traits. In bumblebees, long-tongued species (indicating specialization) were increased during succession. In butterflies and diurnal moths, colonization success of species was strongly correlated with their wing span (indicating mobility). The most successful colonizers in butterflies were grass feeders and in diurnal moths the species feeding on leguminous plants at the larval stage.5.?Synthesis and applications. The ecological requirements of different pollinator groups should be taken into account when establishing set-aside. Supporting bumblebees is possible even on short-term set-aside, assuming nectar and pollen sources are made available. The occurrence of butterflies and diurnal moths is strongly driven by additional factors, such as the availability of larval host plants as well as adult mobility, which calls for set-aside management regimes to be in place for several years.},

Occupancy models have emerged as a popular approach for inferring species occurrence because they account for problems associated with imperfect detection in field surveys. Current models, however, are limited because they assume covariates are independent (i.e., indirect effects do not occur). Here, we combined structural equation and occupancy models to investigate complex influences on species occurrence while accounting for imperfect detection. These two methods are inherently compatible because they both provide means to make inference on latent or unobserved quantities based on observed data. Our models evaluated the direct and indirect roles of cattle grazing, water chemistry, vegetation, nonnative fishes, and pond permanence on the occurrence of six pond-breeding amphibians, two of which are threatened: the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and the California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii). While cattle had strong effects on pond vegetation and water chemistry, their overall effects on amphibian occurrence were small compared to the consistently negative effects of nonnative fish. Fish strongly reduced occurrence probabilities for four of five native amphibians, including both species of conservation concern. These results could help to identify drivers of amphibian declines and to prioritize strategies for amphibian conservation. More generally, this approach facilitates a more mechanistic representation of ideas about the causes of species distributions in space and time. As shown here, occupancy modeling and structural equation modeling are readily combined, and bring rich sets of techniques that may provide unique theoretical and applied insights into basic ecological questions.},

In this study we compared margin characteristics and wild bee community structure from sites with landscapes of varying agricultural intensity in order to (i) investigate if field margins are valuable for wild bee conservation in all types of landscapes, and (ii) determine which biotic and abiotic margin characteristics best support wild bee abundance and community richness. Margin surveys and wild bee community sampling, comprising pan traps and observations of foraging activity, were carried out over three years at 27 cereal field margins in Catalonia, Spain. Generalized linear models indicated a strong inverse relationship between surrounding landscape diversity and wild bee abundance. The proportion of Halictidae bees (common generalists) increased with decreasing landscape complexity. Floral richness exhibited a positive association with number of foraging bees and morphospecies richness, and was positively correlated with the proportion of shrubs and trees represented in the margins. It was observed that wider margins held a higher proportion of perennial plants and a lower proportion of Halictidae bees. Our study suggests that field margins are more crucial in intensively farmed areas than in heterogeneous landscapes where foraging resources are more abundant. Maintaining wide margins with high flowering plant richness, comprising perennial and shrub species, best supports a dense and diverse bee community. In more diverse landscapes, conservation efforts focused on maintaining the quality of existing natural patches may be most effective.},

  abstract  = {The negative effects of climate change on cocoa production are often enhanced through agricultural intensification, while research institutions and enterprises try to minimize yield gaps with production strategies mitigating climate risk. Ecological intensification is such a production strategy, whereby yield increase is promoted through reduced agrochemical inputs and increased regulating ecosystem services such as pollination. However, we still know little about cocoa pollination ecology and services, although they appear to be key to understand yield functions. Here, we provide an extensive literature review on cocoa pollination focusing on three main aspects: non-plant (external) and plant regulated (internal) factors affecting pollination, pollinator agents, and ecological intensification management for enhancing pollination success and yield. Pollination services by many arthropod groups such as ants, bees, and parasitic wasps, and not only ceratopogonids, may be a way to increase cocoa productivity and secure smallholders income, but their role is unknown. Several environmental and socioeconomic factors can blur potential pollination benefits. Current knowledge gaps preclude our understanding of how to (i) identify the major pollinator species, (ii) disentangle the direct or indirect role of ants in pollination, (iii) design effective habitat improvements for pollination (by litter and shade management), and (iv) quantify the yield gaps due to pollination limitation. Optimizing cocoa pollination alone appears to be a powerful ecological tool to increase the yield of smallholders, but experimental research is required to validate these results in a realistic setting. In general, industry, governments and smallholders need to develop more joined efforts to ecological production strategies. In particular, farm-base management innovations based on robust scientific evidence must be designed to meet the increasing demand for chocolate and to mitigate cocoa yield gaps. This review suggests that diversified systems and associated ecosystem services, such as pollination, can help to achieve such goals.},

  abstract  = {Structural equation modeling (SEM) is increasingly being chosen by researchers as a framework for gaining scientific insights from the quantitative analyses of data. New ideas and methods emerging from the study of causality, influences from the field of graphical modeling, and advances in statistics are expanding the rigor, capability, and even purpose of SEM. Guidelines for implementing the expanded capabilities of SEM are currently lacking. In this paper we describe new developments in SEM that we believe constitute a third-generation of the methodology. Most characteristic of this new approach is the generalization of the structural equation model as a causal graph. In this generalization, analyses are based on graph theoretic principles rather than analyses of matrices. Also, new devices such as metamodels and causal diagrams, as well as an increased emphasis on queries and probabilistic reasoning, are now included. Estimation under a graph theory framework permits the use of Bayesian or likelihood methods. The guidelines presented start from a declaration of the goals of the analysis. We then discuss how theory frames the modeling process, requirements for causal interpretation, model specification choices, selection of estimation method, model evaluation options, and use of queries, both to summarize retrospective results and for prospective analyses.The illustrative example presented involves monitoring data from wetlands on Mount Desert Island, home of Acadia National Park. Our presentation walks through the decision process involved in developing and evaluating models, as well as drawing inferences from the resulting prediction equations. In addition to evaluating hypotheses about the connections between human activities and biotic responses, we illustrate how the structural equation (SE) model can be queried to understand how interventions might take advantage of an environmental threshold to limit Typha invasions.The guidelines presented provide for an updated definition of the SEM process that subsumes the historical matrix approach under a graph-theory implementation. The implementation is also designed to permit complex specifications and to be compatible with various estimation methods. Finally, they are meant to foster the use of probabilistic reasoning in both retrospective and prospective considerations of the quantitative implications of the results.},

  abstract  = {This study documents the stingless bees' (Meliponinae) recent displacement in the Yucatan (Quintana Roo, Mexico) and the effects of human-induced ecosystem disturbance on bee diversity. Point observations of flower-visiting bees were made along transects in three communities with different degrees of human-induced ecosystem disturbance. The community with the greatest anthropogenic disturbance had lower overall species richness of stingless bees and the highest degree of dominance of the Africanized honeybee (Apis mellifera scutellata), while the area with the most intact ecosystem had the highest diversity of stingless bees, though A. mellifera was still the dominant species. We observed aggressive competitive behavior involving physical attacks by A. mellifera against stingless bees, indicating that Africanized honeybees are adopting new behaviors to compete better with dominant native pollinator species.},

  abstract  = {Yield production in flowering crops depends on both nutrient availability and pollination, but their relative roles and potential interactions are poorly understood. We measured pollination benefits to yield in sunflower, combining a gradient in insect pollination (0, 25, 50, 100\%) with a continuous gradient in nitrogen (N) fertilization (from 0 to 150 kg N ha-1) in an experiment under realistic soil field conditions. We found that pollination benefits to yield were maximized at intermediate levels of N availability, bolstering yield by approximately 25\% compared with complete pollinator exclusion. Interestingly, we found little decrease in yield when insect visits were reduced by 50\%, indicating that the incremental contribution of pollination by insects to yield is greater when the baseline pollination service provision is very low. Our findings provide strong evidence for interactive, nonlinear effects of pollination and resource availability on seed production. Our results support ecological intensification as a promising strategy for sustainable management of agroecosystems. In particular, we found optimal level of pollination to potentially compensate for lower N applications.},

Here, we show that fruit set of the self{\textendash}fertilizing highland coffee (Coffea arabica) is highly variable and related to bee pollination. In a comparison of 24 agroforestry systems in Indonesia, the fruit set of coffee could be predicted by the number of flower{\textendash}visiting bee species, and it ranged from ca. 60\% (three species) to 90\% (20 species). Diversity, not abundance, explained variation in fruit set, so the collective role of a species{\textendash}rich bee community was important for pollination success. Additional experiments showed that single flower visits from rare solitary species led to higher fruit set than with abundant social species. Pollinator diversity was affected by two habitat parameters indicating guild{\textendash}specific nesting requirements: the diversity of social bees decreased with forest distance, whereas the diversity of solitary bees increased with light intensity of the agroforestry systems. These results give empirical evidence for a positive relationship between ecosystem functions such as pollination and biodiversity. Conservation of rainforest adjacent to adequately managed agroforestry systems could improve the yields of farmers.},

Habitat conversion exceeds habitat protection by a ratio of 8 : 1 in temperate grasslands and Mediterranean biomes, and 10 : 1 in more than 140 ecoregions. These regions include some of the most biologically distinctive, species rich ecosystems on Earth, as well as the last home of many threatened and endangered species.

A general expectation is that a decreasing cover of semi-natural habitats negatively affects pollinator reproduction, population size and pollination services, but few studies have investigated the simultaneous effects of landscape complexity on different aspects of pollinator communities and functioning. In 20 agricultural landscape plots the size of an average Dutch farm, we studied how changing landscape complexity affected wild bee abundance, species richness and reproduction. To measure pollination, we placed potted strawberry plants as phytometers in landscapes. Landscape complexity was characterized as the area of semi-natural habitats. In addition, we estimated floral resource abundance in each landscape plot. We expected that i) bee species richness, reproduction and pollination would be positively related to area of semi-natural habitats and flower abundance, and that ii) species richness and reproduction would be positively related to pollination. An increase in semi-natural habitats in landscapes increased both the abundance of cavity-nesting bees colonizing trap nests, and the growth rates of experimental Bombus terrestris L. colonies, but not the species richness of wild bees measured by pan traps. There was only a tendency for higher pollination levels of strawberry plants with higher cover of semi-natural habitats. There was no relationship between species richness and bee reproduction in a landscape and the pollination services. Estimated flower abundance in landscape had a positive effect on bumblebee colony growth only and not on the other variables. Our results suggest that, by improving habitat quality on their farms through establishing more semi-natural habitats or enhancing the flower availability in semi-natural habitats, farmers can promote reproduction of a number of functionally important bee species and the pollination services they provide. Bee species richness, however, seems to be more difficult to enhance and requires more than just creating more of the same type of habitats or flowers.},

  abstract  = {* Pollination services, especially those of bees, play a vital role in agriculture. Declining honeybee populations require us to find alternative solutions for sustainable agriculture. Native bees are proving to be efficient pollinators. Mason bees (Osmia lignaria) provide valuable pollinator services for some woody orchard species, but their value as pollinators for herbaceous crops is largely untested.
* We assessed the effectiveness of O. lignaria supplementation on nine strawberry farms over two growing seasons. We specifically selected mason bees for this work because they emerge from cocoons in the springtime, when few other bees are available for pollination. Cocoons are easily deployed on farms and emerged bees have a small flight radius, so they remain localized. We placed cocoons on one side of each berry farm plot (our mason bee addition treatment) but not on the opposite side (our control). We tagged and monitored berries on nine farms throughout the growing season. We performed statistical comparisons of berries from the treatment and control for differences in berry growth rate and size. In addition, we supplemented farms with native bee homes constructed from three materials (bamboo, Phragmites and wood). This allowed us to determine whether adult mason bees would produce a subsequent generation of bees on farms and whether the bees had a preference for nest material type.
* Our work demonstrates that mason bees can be used successfully to pollinate herbaceous berry crops. We found that berry growth rate was significantly higher and berry volume was significantly larger for berries from the treatment relative to the control. We also found that adult bees successfully utilized the bee homes for laying the next generation of offspring and that bees colonized bamboo homes more than other home types.
* Synthesis and applications. Our results are the first to show that native mason bees (Osmia lignaria) can be used successfully to provide pollination services on strawberry farms. Their use results in the production of bigger berries and faster berry growth rates than managed honeybees alone. Mason bees overwinter (and can be purchased) in cocoons, offering great potential for efficient and effective pollination services, for a variety of agricultural applications across different geographical regions. The availability of suitable nesting sites and protection of subsequent generations of cocoons from wasp parasitization warrant future consideration.},

  abstract  = {The introduction of an alien plant is widely assumed to have negative consequences for the pollinator-mediated fitness of nearby natives. Indeed, a number of studies, including a highly cited meta-analysis, have concluded that the trend for such interactions is competitive. Here we provide evidence that publication bias and study design have obscured our ability to assess the pollinator-mediated impacts of alien plants. In a meta-analysis of 76 studies, we demonstrate that alien/native status does not predict the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions among plants. Moreover, we found no evidence that similarity in floral traits or phylogenetic distance between species pairs influences the outcome of pollinator-mediated interactions. Instead, we report that aspects of study design, such as distance between the control and nearest neighbour, and/or the arrangement of study plants better predict the impact of a neighbour than does alien/native status. Our study sheds new light on the role that publication bias and experimental design play in the evaluation of key patterns in ecology. We conclude that, due to the absence of clear, generalisable pollinator-mediated impacts of alien species, management schemes should base decisions on community-wide assessments of the impacts of individual alien plant species, and not solely on alien/native status itself.},

However, consequences for crop yield have been poorly evaluated. Above ground, increased landscape complexity is assumed to enhance biological pest control, whereas below ground, soil organic carbon is a proxy for several yield-supporting services. In a field experiment replicated in 114 fields across Europe, we found that fertilisation had the strongest positive effect on yield, but hindered simultaneous harnessing of below- and above-ground ecosystem services. We furthermore show that enhancing natural enemies and pest control through increasing landscape complexity can prove disappointing in fields with low soil services or in intensively cropped regions. Thus, understanding ecological interdependences between land use, ecosystem services and yield is necessary to promote more environmentally friendly farming by identifying situations where ecosystem services are maximised and agrochemical inputs can be reduced.},

  abstract  = {Past studies have shown that taxa from disparate groups often respond similarly to reduced reproductive effort. These common responses imply that high reproductive effort trades off with a consistent set of other life functions for most angiosperms, albeit modulated by their growth form and life history. However, many questions remain about reproductive trade-offs in plants, including just how many other life functions they involve, how diverse these functions may be, and how the severity of these trade-offs may vary through time. To address these questions in a long-lived, iteroparous shrub, we performed flower removal on plots of lowbush blueberry, Vaccinium angustifolium (Ericaceae), over 3 years. We found significant physiological differences between removal and control plots for ten diverse traits. Vegetative phenology was shifted earlier by about 20{\%} in removal plots, and removal plots had about 15{\%} more vegetative biomass by mid-season as well. Removal plots produced about 10{\%} more ripe fruit per reproductive node by harvest than control plots, and reproductive nodes in removal plots produced at least one fruit by harvest about 6{\%} more often. While fruit water content and titratable acidity were increased by removal, other fruit traits, such as sugar content and fresh mass, were not. The strength of the removal effect varied significantly by year for seven traits; for many, such as vegetative mass/stem and ripe fruit production/node, the effect was stronger in years with more stressful abiotic conditions. Our results demonstrate that there are tangible but variable costs to high reproductive effort for flowering plants.},

Using an 8-year dataset comprising nearly 20 000 pollinator visitation records, we explore the assembly of plant–pollinator communities at native plant restoration sites in an agricultural landscape. We find that species occupy highly dynamic network positions through time, causing the assembly process to be punctuated by major network reorganisations. The most persistent pollinator species are also the most variable in their network positions, contrary to what preferential attachment – the most widely studied theory of ecological network assembly – predicts. Instead, we suggest assembly occurs via an opportunistic attachment process. Our results contribute to our understanding of how communities assembly and how species interactions change through time while helping to inform efforts to reassemble robust communities.},

  abstract  = {* Neonicotinoid insecticides are routinely used as seed treatments on most grain and oilseed crops in the USA, yet the extent and likelihood of spread of insecticide residues during planting has not previously been quantified.


* Honey bees, Apis mellifera, are highly mobile and highly sensitive to neonicotinoid residues, presenting an opportunity to estimate non-target exposures to neonicotinoids in mobile insects. We measured neonicotinoid dust drift during maize sowing and used sites of maize fields, apiary locations and honey bee foraging radii to estimate likelihood of forager exposure. We performed a concurrent multi-year field assessment of the pest management benefits of neonicotinoid-treated maize.


* Our results indicate that over 94% of honey bee foragers throughout the state of Indiana are at risk of exposure to varying levels of neonicotinoid insecticides, including lethal levels, during sowing of maize. We documented no benefit of the insecticidal seed treatments for crop yield during the study.


* Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate movement of neonicotinoid residues well beyond planted fields occurs during maize sowing in Indiana. Based on locations of maize fields and apiaries in the state, the likelihood of neonicotinoid exposure for foraging honey bees is high. Other non-target organisms are also likely to encounter neonicotinoid residues; we conservatively estimate that deposition of neonicotinoid residues on non-target lands and waterways will occur on over 42% of the state of Indiana during the period of maize sowing. However, we also demonstrate that the risk to pollinators and other non-target organisms may be rapidly and dramatically reduced without yield penalties, by aligning use rates of neonicotinoid insecticides with pest incidence.},

  abstract = {Intensification of agriculture has been one of the major drivers for biodiversity loss in recent decades. Pollinators, which serve an important role in pollinating crops as well as wild plants, have shown a decline in species richness. Flower strips can be used to support pollinators in agro-ecosystems, however the question remains as to how their design can be optimized in order to best benefit pollinators. Increasing plant species diversity has been shown to be beneficial for pollinators, and it is often suggested that functional traits are driving this relationship. Therefore, increasing plant functional diversity could be a tool to support pollinator abundance and diversity. As experimental evidence on this relationship is scarce, we developed a field study with experimental sown flower strips with four functional diversity levels, based on multiple flower traits and with equal plant species richness. We monitored vegetation development, as well as the flower-visiting pollinator community and their interaction networks with flowers. We were able to create a functional diversity gradient while controlling for plant species richness and evenness. However, in contrast to our expectations, pollinator species richness and evenness were not influenced by functional diversity, and increasing functional diversity even resulted in lower flower visitation rates. Network stability metrics showed no effect or negative relationships with functional diversity. We conclude that increasing functional diversity was not the key for supporting pollinators in wildflower strips. Our results also suggest that, for a constant amount of flower resources, increasing plant functional diversity and thus decreasing redundancy of potential pollinator feeding niches, decreases the amount of flower resources present per feeding niche. As pollinator species tended to have less overlap in their feeding niches in flower strips with increased functional diversity, this may lead to a reduction of flower resources available for pollinator species with a more specialized feeding niche.},

Aphthona lacertosa and Aphthona nigriscutis have been released at more than 1800 points in the 18,600-ha South Unit of the park beginning in 1989; most releases have occurred since 1994. We established permanent vegetation plots throughout the infested area of the park and determined stem counts and biomass of leafy spurge and abundance of the two flea beetle species at these plots each year from 1999 to 2001. Both biomass and stem counts declined over the 3 years of the study. Both species of flea beetle are well established within the park and have expanded into areas where they were not released. A. nigriscutis was more abundant than A. lacertosa in the grassland areas we surveyed, but in all other habitats abundances were similar. Using structural equation models, only A. lacertosa could be shown to have a significant effect on counts of mature stems of leafy spurge. A. nigriscutis numbers were positively correlated with stem counts of mature stems. Previous year’s stem counts had the greatest influence on change in stem counts over each 2-year time step examined with structural equation models.},

The components of a general theory of ecology have existed for the past half century; ecologists simply have failed to explicitly recognize them. We present a general theory of ecology and show how it relates to ecology's numerous constituent theories and models. The general theory consists of a description of the domain of ecology and a set of fundamental principles. The domain of ecology is the spatial and temporal patterns of the distribution and abundance of organisms, including causes and consequences. Fundamental principles are broad statements about the patterns that exist and the processes that operate within a domain. The seven fundamental principles of the theory of ecology are: the heterogeneous distribution of organisms, interactions of organisms, contingency, environmental heterogeneity, finite and heterogeneous resources, the mortality of organisms, and the evolutionary cause of ecological properties. These principles are the necessary and sufficient elements for a general theory of ecology. The propositions of any constituent theory of ecology can be shown to be a consequence of these fundamental principles along with principles from other science domains. The general theory establishes relationships among constituent theories through shared fundamental principles. The next challenge is to develop and integrate unified, constituent theories and to establish the relationships among them within the framework established by the general theory.},

We used structural equation modelling to test the importance of direct and indirect (via floral resources) climate effects on the interannual abundance of three subalpine bumble bee species. In addition, we used long-term data to examine how climate and floral resources have changed over time. Over 8 years, bee abundances were driven primarily by the indirect effects of climate on the temporal distribution of floral resources. Over 43 years, aspects of floral phenology changed in ways that indicate species-specific effects on bees. Our study suggests that climate-driven alterations in floral resource phenology can play a critical role in governing bee population responses to global change.},

Within the terminal raceme, both a decreased proportion of fertile ovules and a lower number of ovules per ovary in apical flowers contributed to the lower number of seeds per pod in the mature apical pods compared to the basal ones. A study of ovule development before flower opening showed that differences in the differentiation of the embryo sacs arose before the buds were 40 mm long and probably involved the stages of meiosis II and/or differentiation of the chalazal megaspore.},

To elucidate the genetic architecture and uncover the mechanism of SNPP, we identified five quantitative trait loci (QTLs) using the BnaZNRIL population, which were integrated with those of previous studies by physical map to demonstrate a complex and relatively complete genetic architecture of SNPP. A major QTL, qSN.A6, was successfully fine-mapped from 1910 to 267 kb using near-isogenic line (NIL). In addition, qSN.A6 exhibited an antagonistic pleiotropy on seed weight (SW), which is caused by a physiological interaction in which SNPP acts “upstream” of SW. Because the negative effect of qSN.A6 on SW cannot fully counteract its positive effect on SNPP, it also enhanced the final yield (17.4%), indicating its great potential for utilization in breeding. The following genetic and cytological experiments further confirmed that the different rate of ovule abortion was responsible for the ~5 seed difference between Zhongshuang11 and NIL-qSN.A6. This systematic approach to dissecting the comprehensive genetic architecture of SNPP and characterizing the underlying mechanism has advanced the understanding of SNPP and will facilitate the development of high-yield cultivars.},

We find that strong competitive asymmetry, high resource levels, and intermediate harshness of the precompetitive environment favor coexistence of plants with different seed sizes. If the evolution of seed size is mutation-limited and single mutations have only a small phenotypic effect, then an initially monomorphic population reaches the final evolutionarily stable polymorphic state through one or more discrete evolutionary branching events. At each such branching event, a given lineage already present in the population divides into two phenotypically diverging daughter lines, each with its own seed size. If the precompetitive survival of seeds and seedlings is high for small and large seeds alike, however, evolutionary branching may be followed by the extinction of one or more lineages. Various results presented here are model-independent and point the way to a more general evolutionary bifurcation theory describing how the number and stability properties of evolutionary equilibria may change as a consequence of changes in model parameters.},

Although flowering on the HTS-treated plants, during both the 1 week and 2 week HTS treatments, was equal to that of control-grown plants, fruit and seed development, as well as seed weight, were significantly reduced. Under HTS, flowers either developed into seedless, parthenocarpic fruit or aborted on the stem. At the cessation of the HTS, plants compensated for the lack of fruit and seed production by increasing the number of lateral inflorescences produced. During the HTS, pollen viability and germinability were slightly reduced. In vitro pollen tube growth at 35 C, from both control pollen and pollen developed under a HTS, appeared abnormal, however, in vivo tube growth to the micropyle appeared normal. Reciprocal pollination of HTS or control pistils with HTS or control pollen indicated that the combined effects of HTS on both micro- and megagametophytes was required to knock out fruit and seed development. Expression profiles for a subset of HEAT SHOCK PROTEINs (HSP101, HSP70, HSP17.6) showed that both micro- and megagametophytes were thermosensitive despite HTS-induced expression from these genes.},

  abstract  = {Abstract This paper reviews the most important biological processes that determine the yield of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). Biological yield is the product of growth rate and duration of the growing period, both of which indicate the potential for improvement in yield. Likewise, a greater harvest index leads to a higher seed yield. A brief survey of five recently published rapeseed crop models is given. Most of these models are poor predictors of biomass and yield; there is a lack of information about key physiological processes involved in establishment of the stand, the production of biomass and formation of yield, cessation of growth in winter, flowering and post-anthesis growth. During flowering and pod set, the relation between source and sink regulates the availability of assimilates necessary for seed filling. The most source-limiting process is related to small photosynthetically active area, caused by a drastic decline in the leaf area index from the start of flowering despite a slow increase in the assimilating pod area. To analyse yield, it is necessary to understand the structure of the yield and the primary and secondary components, which determine seed yield. Plant density governs the components of yield and, thus, the yield of individual plants. A uniform distribution of plants per unit area is a prerequisite for yield stability. The number of pods per plant is decisive for seed yield; this trait is ultimately determined by the survival of branches, buds, flowers and young pods rather than by the potential number of flowers and pods. Seed number per pod is correlated with pod length. It is, therefore, concluded that pod length is a suitable trait for indirect selection in plant breeding.},

As a cash crop, coffee cultivation gained popularity in the Old and then the New world, and flourished under colonial regimes of the nineteenth and twentieth century. Coffee production patterns and management styles have changed ­drastically in the past two centuries and continue to shift, with the greatest recent expansions in East Asia. Traditionally, coffee is cultivated under a canopy of shade trees, a practice that ensures the longevity of the farm, supports biodiversity, and provides communities with a broad array of ecosystem services. However, many modern management schemes abandon shade practices. On the other hand, specialty coffee markets, like certified organic, certified shade (Bird Friendly), Fair Trade, and other certified coffees have gained recent popularity, though they still represent a small fraction of the global coffee economy. The global coffee economy is comprised of a wide array of coffee value chains that connect farmers with consumers, and thus impact farmer livelihoods at multiple spatial scales. Key players in the coffee value chain include local cooperatives, national government agencies, and global certification agencies. Similarly, ecosystem services provided by shade coffee occur at local, regional, and global scales, including pollination, erosion-control, and carbon sequestration, respectively. While the ecological and socio-economic costs and benefits associated with shade coffee are clear, this review reveals that there are many challenges to bridging sustainable coffee management with livelihood security. Furthermore, in this review we identify existing gaps in the literature and a number of promising research directions concerning the ecological and socio-economic impacts of coffee production.},

Agroforestry, such as shade-coffee production, contributes to biodiversity conservation. However, falling coffee prices force many coffee growers to convert their sites into economically more attractive land uses. We performed an economic evaluation of coffee pollination by bees in two distinct tropical regions: an area of low human impact with forests neighboring agroforestry in Indonesia and an area of high human impact with little remaining forest in Ecuador. We evaluated bee pollination for different forest-destruction scenarios, where coffee yields depend on forests to provide nesting sites for bees. We used two novel approaches. First, we examined how coffee net revenues depend on the pollination services of adjacent forests by considering berry weight in addition to fruit set, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation. Second, we determined the net welfare effects of land-use changes, including the fact that former forestland is normally used for alternative crops. In both regions, crop revenues exceeded coffee pollination values, generating incentives to convert forests, even if owners would be compensated for pollination services. The promotion of certified ``biodiversity-friendly" coffee is a feasible option to maintain shade-coffee systems. This is of special importance in high-impact areas where only small forest fragments remain. We conclude that a comprehensive economic analysis is necessary to adequately evaluate rainforest preservation for the enhancement of ecosystem services, such as pollination.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Though it is undoubted that tropical bees are influenced by habitat composition, few studies have investigated the relative importance of both local and landscape-level habitat parameters in supporting large and diverse bee communities. The conservation of native bee communities within agroforestry landscapes is particularly urgent given the importance of pollination services within these systems. In this study, we examined tropical bee communities within a largely deforested shade coffee-growing region in Chiapas, Mexico. We used regression tree modeling to examine the response of bee functional groups to local and landscape-level habitat management. Our models revealed that the most predictive factors for bee abundance and species richness were the number of tree species, the number of tree species in flower, and the canopy cover of the local agroforestry landscape. Solitary bees were most abundant in habitats with high canopy cover, while social bees were most abundant in habitats with greater tree species richness. Cavity-nesting and wood-nesting bee abundance was positively affected by the amount of canopy cover in the farm, while ground-nesting bees were most abundant in habitats with a large number of tree species in flower. Our results demonstrate that across bee sociality groups, nesting guilds, and tribes, the most critical factor impacting native bee communities was within-farm local vegetation management. These results reveal the important role that agroforestry managers can have on biodiversity conservation, and the potential contribution they can make by creating resource-rich agricultural matrices. Specifically, our findings highlight the importance of diverse overstory tree management in supporting native bee communities within tropical agroforestry systems.},

  abstract  = {Bees and other insects provide pollination services that are key to determining the fruit set on coffee plantations. These pollination services are influenced by local ecology as well as human factors, both social and economic. To better understand these different factors, we assessed their effect on pollinators and coffee pollination services in Santander, Colombia. We quantified the effect of key ecological drivers on pollinator community composition, such as the method of farm management (either conventional or organic) and the surrounding landscape composition, specifically the proximity to forest. We found that ambient levels of pollination services provided by the local pollinator fauna (open pollination) accounted for a 10.5±2.0% increase in final coffee fruit set, and that the various pollinators are affected differently by the differing factors. For example, our findings indicate that conventional farm management, using synthetic inputs, can promote pollinators, especially if they are in close proximity to natural forest fragments. This is particularly true for stingless bees. Honeybee visitation to coffee is also positively influenced by the conventional management of farms. Factors associated with greater numbers of stingless bees on farms include greater shade cover, lower tree densities, smaller numbers and types of trees in bloom, and younger coffee plantations. A forested landscape close to farms appears to enhance these factors, giving increased stability and resilience to the pollinating bees and insects. However we found that organic farms also support diverse pollinator communities, even if distant from forest fragments. The contribution of honeybees to pollination value (US$129.6/ha of coffee) is greater than that of stingless bees (US$16.5/ha of coffee). Since the method of farm management has a major impact on the numbers and types of pollinators attracted to farms, we have analysed the statistically significant social factors that influence farmers’ decisions on whether to adopt organic or conventional practices. These include the availability of technology, the type of landowner (whether married couples or individual owners), the number of years of farmers’ formal education, the role of institutions, membership of community organizations, farm size, coffee productivity and the number of coffee plots per farm. It is hoped that the use of our holistic approach, which combines investigation of the social as well as the ecological drivers of pollination, will help provide evidence to underpin the development of best practices for integrating the management of pollination into sustainable agricultural practices.},

  abstract  = {Science has shown the importance of animal pollinators to human food security, economy, and biodiversity conservation. Science continues to identify various factors causing pollinator declines and their implications. However, translation of the understanding of pollinators’ roles into current policy and regulation is weak and requires attention, both in developed and developing nations. The national and international trade of commodities generated via insect pollination is large. Trade in those crops could be a means of influencing regulations to promote the local existence of pollinating species, apart from their contributions to biodiversity conservation. This paper, using the example of international coffee production, reviews the value of pollinating species, and relates them to simple economics of commodity production. Recommendations are made that could influence policy and decision-making to promote coffee production, trade, and pollinators’ existence. Assumptions and considerations are raised and addressed. Although the role of insect pollinators in promoting fruit set and quality is accepted, implementing pollination conservation in forest habitats may require assured higher prices for coffee, and direct subsidies for forest conservation to prevent conversion to other crop lands. Exporting and importing governments and trade organizations could establish policy that requires insect pollination in the coffee certification process. The European Parliament and the North American Free Trade Agreement could be instrumental in creating policy and regulation that promotes insect pollination services in coffee production. The reciprocity between the services of insect pollinators in certified coffee production and their services in forest biodiversity production should be implicit in future policy negotiations to enhance both systems.},

These changes predict the identities of winners and losers of future global change, and also reveal which environmental variables drive a taxon's response to land use change. We explored how the biodiversity of native bee species changes across forested, agricultural, and urban landscapes. We collected bee community data from 36 sites across a 75,000 km2 region, and analyzed bee abundance, species richness, composition, and life-history traits. Season-long bee abundance and richness were not detectably different between natural and anthropogenic landscapes, but community phenologies differed strongly, with an early spring peak followed by decline in forests, and a more extended summer season in agricultural and urban habitats. Bee community composition differed significantly between all three land use types, as did phylogenetic composition. Anthropogenic land use had negative effects on the persistence of several life-history strategies, including early spring flight season and brood parasitism, which may indicate adaptation to conditions in forest habitat. Overall, anthropogenic communities are not diminished subsets of contemporary natural communities. Rather, forest species do not persist in anthropogenic habitats, but are replaced by different native species and phylogenetic lineages preadapted to open habitats. Characterizing compositional and functional differences is crucial for understanding land use as a global change driver across large regional scales.},

Critical discourse analysis highlights the ideological work language does; the way in which we think, write, and talk about the environment has important implications for how it is governed. Consequently, the widespread use of economic metaphors is politically significant. This article discusses how metaphors have been analysed in environmental policy research, surveys the use of prominent economic metaphors in environmental policy, and considers the politics associated with such terms. The uptake of various economic metaphors represents a form of reverse discourse, varies in politically significant ways, and narrows the terms of environmental debate.},

Radio-tracking, with frequent sampling so that successive observations are dependent, is an important special case to which only a single narrow class of models has been applied. The standard approach uses a bivariate Ornstein–Uhlenbeck diffusion process, for which the stationary distribution is always normal, limiting its flexibility for modelling stationary home range or territorial behaviour. I describe a new class of random diffusion models for animal movement, flexible enough to incorporate many realistic features, but simple enough to be estimated statistically and to be interpreted behaviourally. The models incorporate a finite number of different behavioural or physiological states for an animal, and a set of diffusion rules describing the movement of the animal while in particular states. Mathematically, the models are diffusions in finite random temporal environments. The class of models generalizes the standard Ornstein–Uhlenbeck model (which can be thought of as the 1-state case), and can represent features such as multimodal and asymmetric home ranges and utilization distributions. I give a range of examples of particular models within this class, including an application to the modelling of the movements of wood mice, for which radio-tracking can give information on behaviour, as well as location.},

It is often assumed in foraging theory that the flight lengths of a forager have a characteristic scale: from this assumption gaussian, Rayleigh and other classical distributions with well-defined variances have arisen. However, such theories cannot explain the long-tailed power-law distributions of flight lengths or flight times that are observed experimentally. Here we study how the search efficiency depends on the probability distribution of flight lengths taken by a forager that can detect target sites only in its limited vicinity. We show that, when the target sites are sparse and can be visited any number of times, an inverse square power-law distribution of flight lengths, corresponding to Lévy flight motion, is an optimal strategy. We test the theory by analysing experimental foraging data on selected insect, mammal and bird species, and find that they are consistent with the predicted inverse square power-law distributions.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The Centre for Adaptive Behaviour and Cognition (ABC) has hypothesised that much human decision-making can be described by simple algorithmic process models (heuristics). This paper explains this approach and relates it to research in biology on rules of thumb, which we also review. As an example of a simple heuristic, consider the lexicographic strategy of Take The Best for choosing between two alternatives: cues are searched in turn until one discriminates, then search stops and all other cues are ignored. Heuristics consist of building blocks, and building blocks exploit evolved or learned abilities such as recognition memory; it is the complexity of these abilities that allows the heuristics to be simple. Simple heuristics have an advantage in making decisions fast and with little information, and in avoiding overfitting. Furthermore, humans are observed to use simple heuristics. Simulations show that the statistical structures of different environments affect which heuristics perform better, a relationship referred to as ecological rationality. We contrast ecological rationality with the stronger claim of adaptation. Rules of thumb from biology provide clearer examples of adaptation because animals can be studied in the environments in which they evolved. The range of examples is also much more diverse. To investigate them, biologists have sometimes used similar simulation techniques to ABC, but many examples depend on empirically driven approaches. ABC's theoretical framework can be useful in connecting some of these examples, particularly the scattered literature on how information from different cues is integrated. Optimality modelling is usually used to explain less detailed aspects of behaviour but might more often be redirected to investigate rules of thumb.},

  abstract  = {* The decline of managed honeybees and the rapid expansion of mass-flowering crops increase the risk of pollination limitation in crops and raise questions about novel management approaches for wild pollinators in agroecosystems. Adding artificial nesting sites, such as trap nests, can promote cavity-nesting bees in agroecosystems, but effectiveness could be limited by the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape and by natural antagonists.


* In two European regions, we exposed artificial trap nests in paired field boundaries adjacent to oilseed rape (OSR) fields or non-flowering crops for 2 years within 32 landscapes covering two independent gradients of OSR cover and semi-natural habitat (SNH) cover in the landscape. We analysed the effects of local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity, landscape complexity and natural antagonists on community composition and population dynamics of trap-nesting bees.


* Numbers of brood cells showed a strong, three-fold increase in response to the additional nesting sites. Species richness and abundance of cavity-nesting bees that were active during OSR flowering increased significantly with increasing amounts of early season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of OSR. Later foraging species benefited instead from the availability of late-season alternative flower resources or SNH cover once the mass-flowering had ceased. Density-dependent parasitism increased following mass-flowering, while no density-dependent effect was found during mass-flowering.


* Structural equation modelling revealed that the influence of floral resource availability on community growth rate was mediated by community size. Community size showed a strong negative effect on community growth rate. Despite positive density-dependent parasitism, antagonists had only weak regulating effects on community growth rate.


* Synthesis and applications. Trap-nesting bee populations grow markedly with the increasing availability of food resources in the landscape and effectiveness of trap nests is only marginally limited by natural antagonists. Thus, trap nests could be a simple pollinator-supporting strategy to accompany the current expansion of mass-flowering crops and to ensure pollination services for insect-pollinated crops. Trap nests benefit, not only early season active generalist bees during oilseed rape flowering, but also species with later phenology if accompanied by other pollinator-supporting practices.},

I compared the bee community in each manipulated plot with bees on the same flower species in control plots. The bee morphospecies composition in manipulations with only tube flowers remaining was the same as that in the control plots, while the bee morphospecies on only open flowers were dissimilar from those in control plots. However, the proportion of short- and long-tongued bees on focal flowers did not differ between control and manipulated plots for either manipulation. So, bees within some functional groups are more strongly linked to their floral trait partners than others. And, it may be more fruitful to describe expected bee community compositions in terms of relative proportions of relevant ecological traits than species, particularly in species-diverse communities.},

  abstract  = {Increasing cultivation of oilseed rape may have consequences for pollinators and wild plant pollination. By providing pollinating insects with pollen and nectar, oilseed rape benefits short-tongued, generalist insect species. Long-tongued bumble bee species, specialized to other flower types, may instead be negatively affected by increased competition from the generalists (e.g. due to nectar-robbing of long-tubed flowers) after oilseed rape flowering has ceased. We expected that the increased abundance of short-tongued pollinators and reduced abundance of long-tongued bumble bees in landscapes with a high proportion of oilseed rape would impact the pollination of later flowering wild plant species. In addition, we expected contrasting effects on plants pollinated by short-tongued pollinators and those pollinated by long-tongued bumble bees. We predicted that semi-natural grasslands, which provide insects with alternative floral resources, would reduce both negative and positive effects on pollination by mitigating competition between pollinators. In 16 semi-natural grasslands, surrounded by agricultural landscapes, with a variation in both the proportion of oilseed rape and the proportion of semi-natural grassland within 1km, we studied reproductive output in two species of potted plants with different pollination strategies: the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) and red clover (Trifolium pratense). The first species is mainly pollinated by short-tongued pollinators, e.g. hoverflies and solitary bees, and the latter by long-tongued bumble bees. Both species flowered after oilseed rape. Strawberry weight was higher in landscapes with a high proportion of oilseed rape, but only in landscapes with a low proportion of semi-natural grassland. The proportion of developed achenes was also positively related to the proportion of oilseed rape, but only during the latest flowering period. In contrast, red clover seed set was unrelated to the proportion of oilseed rape. Whereas the discrepancy between the two strawberry measurements calls for further research, this study suggests that oilseed rape can affect later flowering plants and that the impact differs among species.},

  abstract  = {To clarify the linkage between flowering phenology and pollination success in alpine plant communities, we quantified the seasonality of flower visitors, the temporal transition of floral resources, and the variation in pollination success of alpine plants in northern Japan. Bumble bees, syrphid flies, and non-syrphid flies were the predominant flower visitors. Foraging activity of bumble bees increased toward the late flowering period reflecting the life cycle of colony development. The activity of syrphid flies was sensitive to ambient temperature, while that of non-syrphid flies remained high throughout the season. Flower production of bee-pollinated plants fluctuated significantly between years with a bimodal pattern peaking in the early and late periods, while flower production of fly-pollinated plants was less variable between years. Fruit-set success of bee-pollinated plants increased considerably from the early to the late flowering period, while the trend for fly-pollinated plants was less marked. Three times more visits of dipteran insects are necessary for fly-pollinated plants to achieve fruiting success comparable to bee-pollinated plants. Bumble bees are potentially excellent pollinators, but the visitation frequency is low early in the season. Lower pollination ability of dipteran insects may be compensated for by abundant flower visits. The relationships between flowering phenology and fruit-set success of alpine plant communities highly depend on the type of pollinators.},

  abstract  = {Ecological interactions are highly dynamic in time and space. Previous studies of plant–animal mutualistic networks have shown that the occurrence of interactions varies substantially across years. We analyzed interannual variation of a quantitative mutualistic network, in which links are weighted by interaction frequency. The network was sampled over six consecutive years, representing one of the longest time series for a community-wide mutualistic network. We estimated the interannual similarity in interactions and assessed the determinants of their persistence. The occurrence of interactions varied greatly among years, with most interactions seen in only one year (64%) and few (20%) in more than two years. This variation was associated with the frequency and position of interactions relative to the network core, so that the network consisted of a persistent core of frequent interactions and many peripheral, infrequent interactions. Null model analyses suggest that species abundances play a substantial role in generating these patterns. Our study represents an important step in the study of ecological networks, furthering our mechanistic understanding of the ecological processes driving the temporal persistence of interactions.},

Random walk models, which are commonly used to model animal movement, show diffusion instead of a bounded home range and therefore require special modifications. Current approaches for mechanistic modeling of home ranges apply only to a limited set of taxa, namely territorial animals and/or central place foragers. In this paper we present a more general mechanistic movement model based on a biased correlated random walk, which shows the potential for home-range behavior. The model is based on an animal tracking a dynamic resource landscape, using a biologically plausible two-part memory system, i.e. a reference- and a working-memory. Our results show that by adding these memory processes the random walker produces home-range behavior as it gains experience, which also leads to more efficient resource use. Interestingly, home-range patterns, which we assessed based on home-range overlap and increase in area covered with time, require the combined action of both memory components to emerge. Our model has the potential to predict home-range size and can be used for comparative analysis of the mechanisms shaping home-range patterns.},

After extensive training (80 foraging bouts and at least 640 flower visits), bees reduced their flight distances and prioritized shortest possible routes, while almost never following nearest-neighbour solutions. We discuss possible strategies used during the establishment of stable multi-location routes (or traplines), and how these could allow bees and other animals to solve complex routing problems through experience, without necessarily requiring a sophisticated cognitive representation of space.},

This problem is similar to the well-known traveling salesman problem: A salesman must choose the shortest path from his home office to all cities on his itinerary and back to his home office again. The traveling salesman problem is in a class of enigmatic problems, called NP-complete, which can be so difficult to solve that animals might be incapable of finding the best solution. Two major results of this analysis are: (1) The simple foraging strategy of always moving to the closest resource site does surprisingly well. More sophisticated strategies of “looking ahead” a small number of steps, choosing the shortest path, then taking a step, do worse if all the resource sites are visited, but do slightly better (less than 10%) if not all the resource sites are visited. (2) Short cyclical foraging routes resulted when resources were allowed to renew. This is suggested as an alternative explanation for “trap-lining” in animals that forage for discrete, widely separated resources.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Growing concern about wild and managed pollinator populations has led to efforts to create floral habitat to promote bees and other pollinators, especially in agricultural lands where they make important contributions to crop pollination. These actions all require practitioners to determine what mixture of plant species to select to best support diverse and functionally important pollinators. Like in the selection of areas for nature reserves, plant choices must balance function against differences in cost. To date, plant mixes have been compiled using expert opinion based on the performance of individual species, but researchers and practitioners have called for a systematic approach to optimize mixtures. We applied a decision analytic approach to select best flowering mixes to meet two specified objectives at the least cost: maximizing total bee richness or maximizing crop-pollinating bees. The model identified best plant mixes for each objective across a range of budgets. Accounting for the variation in costs among plant species allowed for substantially more cost effective mixes with little loss in achieving the target objective. Including multiple objectives simultaneously revealed the power of the approach to meet complex goals. The resulting mix supported over 96% of the bee species for both goals at no difference in cost. This gain in efficiency could dramatically increase the extent of habitat implemented and remove financial barriers to adoption by stakeholders and conservation practitioners.},

  abstract  = {* Growing evidence for declines in wild bees calls for the development and implementation of effective mitigation measures. Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape.

* To test this, we established wildflower strips in four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants specifically targeted at bees. We used a before–after control–impact approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees, solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity and landscape complexity.

* Wildflower strips generally enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species. Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season alternative floral resources in the landscape, whereas effects on bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability.

* Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the extent to which local flower richness is increased. The effectiveness of this measure could therefore be enhanced by maximizing the number of bee forage species in seed mixtures, and by management regimes that effectively maintain flower richness in the strips through the years. In addition, for bumblebees specifically, our study highlights the importance of a continuous supply of food resources throughout the season. Measures that enhance early-season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of oilseed rape, can benefit bumblebees by providing the essential resources for colony establishment and growth in spring. Further research is required to determine whether, and under what conditions, wildflower strips result in actual population-level effects.},

Apis mellifera is the most frequent floral visitor in natural habitats worldwide, averaging 13\% of floral visits across all networks (range 0{\textendash}85\%), with 5\% of plant species recorded as being exclusively visited by A. mellifera. For 33\% of the networks and 49\% of plant species, however, A. mellifera visitation was never observed, illustrating that many flowering plant taxa and assemblages remain dependent on non-A. mellifera visitors for pollination. Apis mellifera visitation was higher in warmer, less variable climates and on mainland rather than island sites, but did not differ between its native and introduced ranges. With respect to single-visit pollination effectiveness, A. mellifera did not differ from the average non-A. mellifera floral visitor, though it was generally less effective than the most effective non-A. mellifera visitor. Our results argue for a deeper understanding of how A. mellifera, and potential future changes in its range and abundance, shape the ecology, evolution, and conservation of plants, pollinators, and their interactions in natural habitats.},

Half-viability periods, i.e., the time after which 50% of the initially viable seeds no longer germinate, were short (between 6.5 +/- 0.1 and 23.3 +/- 0.3 d), and large numbers of seeds were produced (between 10000 and 1 x 106 per plant). Mean seed mass ranged from 0.02 +/- 0.001 mg in S. triandra to 0.80 +/- 0.05 mg in P. nigra. Whereas seed mass was, against expectation, positively related to half-viability periods, seed number generally decreased with increasing seed mass.

  abstract  = {Planted meadows are increasingly used to improve the biodiversity and aesthetic amenity value of urban areas. Although many ‘pollinator-friendly’ seed mixes are available, the floral resources these provide to flower-visiting insects, and how these change through time, are largely unknown. Such data are necessary to compare the resources provided by alternative meadow seed mixes to each other and to other flowering habitats. We used quantitative surveys of over 2 million flowers to estimate the nectar and pollen resources offered by two exemplar commercial seed mixes (one annual, one perennial) and associated weeds grown as 300m2 meadows across four UK cities, sampled at six time points between May and September 2013. Nectar sugar and pollen rewards per flower varied widely across 65 species surveyed, with native British weed species (including dandelion, Taraxacum agg.) contributing the top five nectar producers and two of the top ten pollen producers. Seed mix species yielding the highest rewards per flower included Leontodon hispidus, Centaurea cyanus and C. nigra for nectar, and Papaver rhoeas, Eschscholzia californica and Malva moschata for pollen. Perennial meadows produced up to 20x more nectar and up to 6x more pollen than annual meadows, which in turn produced far more than amenity grassland controls. Perennial meadows produced resources earlier in the year than annual meadows, but both seed mixes delivered very low resource levels early in the year and these were provided almost entirely by native weeds. Pollen volume per flower is well predicted statistically by floral morphology, and nectar sugar mass and pollen volume per unit area are correlated with flower counts, raising the possibility that resource levels can be estimated for species or habitats where they cannot be measured directly. Our approach does not incorporate resource quality information (for example, pollen protein or essential amino acid content), but can easily do so when suitable data exist. Our approach should inform the design of new seed mixes to ensure continuity in floral resource availability throughout the year, and to identify suitable species to fill resource gaps in established mixes.},

A high nectar sugar concentration would be an advantage for species competing for pollinators. However, when plants within the species (Medicago sativa) were studied, an advantage for a concentrated nectar was not definitely established.
3. A high volume of nectar is an advantage for alfalfa plants for seed production. Various environmental factors affect nectar secretion. Sunlight appears to be the most important. In general, conditions favorable for plant growth are also favorable for nectar secretion except that overstimulation that produces a vegetative rather than a reproductive phase is probably detrimental.},

  comment   = {The rate of floral nectar production, an important trait for supporting populations of pollinators, is known to be affected by local environment. This study examines the effect, 9 years after an anthropogenic disturbance—variable retention logging,—on the rate of daily nectar production of four common herbs (Chamerion angustifolium, Delphinium glaucum, Mertensia paniculata and Vicia americana) in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada. We measured daily nectar production rates 9 years after experimental logging
in three treatments: clear cuts (all merchantable trees removed), 50% of trees retained, and unlogged controls. Per-flower nectar production rate was unaffected by logging for C. angusifolium, D. glaucum, and M. paniculata, and lower in unlogged controls than in the 50% logging treatment for V. americana. Overall, we found a surprising robustness of nectar production of these herbaceous plants to the physical and environmental changes following logging. While other research has shown boreal forest logging to affect
the densities of understory herbs, the per-flower nectar production in boreal forest understory herbs appears to be relatively insensitive to this disturbance.},

  abstract  = {Bumblebees of any one species in Maine forage for pollen and/or nectar from a large variety of morphologically diverse flowers, but individuals have limited foraging repertoires at any one time. Unspecialized individuals were sometimes unsuccessful in extracting nectar and/or pollen from highly rewarding flowers. In any one area with a variety of concurrently blooming plants, the bumblebees had apparent species preferences. Superimposed on the species preferences were individual preferences. Individuals had primary foraging specialties (their majors) and secondary specialities (their minors). Minors were often bridges to new majors. Queens in Maine necessarily have several successive majors during their lifetime since the blooming time of the plants they utilize are brief relative to their life-span as foragers. However, the blooming time of most plants available to Bombus fervidus workers are long relative to their lifetime. Switching was rarely observed in these bees, even in some individuals observed daily for up to 1 mo at the same foraging area containing other plant species in bloom that were highly attractive to other individuals of the same bumblebee species. On a per flower basis, those flowers producing the most food rewards generally had the largest number of bees majoring from them, and the food rewards available were roughly comparable between different kinds of flowers, regardless of their differences in rates of nectar production. Specializing was usually preceded by sampling a variety of rewarding as well as nonrewarding flowers. When the flowers from which bees were majoring in an area were experimentally removed many of the bees sampled flowers of other concurrently blooming plants, but they generally did not switch to flowers from which the food rewards were being depleted by specialists, unless these were experimentally fortified with syrup. Upon finding superior food rewards in enriched blossoms, they switched immediately. Flower-specificity is related to site-specificity. Many bees shared the same foraging area, but different individual bees at the same site utilized the flowers of different plant species. When the foraging area contained landmarks, the bees visited clumps of flowers in a sequence (foraging path) that was generally repeated several times on the same foraging trip when the foraging site was small. The foraging behavior of bumblebees is discussed from a comparative standpoint with other bees and in relation to food distribution and availability in the environment.},

The concentration of sugar in the nectars of unprotected flowers of several species was measured and did not reach the high values that would be in equilibrium with the daytime humidities recorded outside the corolla, although the sugar concentration was highly correlated with ambient relative humidity. This paper examines features that maintain low nectar sugar concentrations at low ambient humidities. Post-secretory changes in concentration are influenced to a small extent by nectar composition but depend largely on physico-chemical and microclimatic effects. Factors contributing to the maintenance of steep gradients in water activity between the nectar and the ambient air include corolla morphology, sugar concentration gradients and waterproofing lipid monolayers on the nectar surface. This paper considers the relative importance of such features in relation to the pollination syndrome. A simple technique is described for the measurement of intrafloral relative humidity.},

All nectars contained all three sugars with the exception of that of Asclepias. Asclepias nectar was nearly a pure sucrose solution. Sucrose/hexose ratio was correlated with flower morphology, with tubular flowers having more sucrose and open flowers having more hexose. Open flowers contained nectar whose concentration was more affected by relative humidity than tubular flowers. Available nectar in unbagged flowers was found in volumes of 0.1 to 5 ul (17.5 to 68.2% sugar). Total sugar available per blossom amounted to 0.07 to 3.54 mg. We note that care must be taken in converting% concentration to mg sugar. Energetic yield was not as variable as the other measures and ranged from 0.72 to 3.58 cal/ul. Total daily nectar production was measured in five families and 24-hr sugar production varied from 0.64 to 5.52 mg per flower. Insect nectar feeders frequently searched many blossoms with little or no reward, but were rewarded sufficiently at rare "lucky hit" blossoms which contained relatively large nectar rewards. Insect pollinators did not seek nectars of specific sucrose-hexose ratios, but instead took nectar where caloric reward and accessibility made it most profitable.},

Flower size varied greatly among individual plants, while pollen and nectar availability varied among the flowers in association with their sexual phase. Compared to random samples, bumblebees significantly favoured female phase flowers on one day, but favoured male phase flowers on the following day and this change coincided with a decline in overall pollen availability. The bumblebees' behaviour is consistent with a simple economic interpretation: initially, bumblebees favoured female phase flowers, many of which offered both pollen and nectar, but as pollen became less abundant, bumblebees increasingly favoured the relatively pollen-rich, nectarless male phase flowers, which implies that pollen was the more valued resource. Like previous studies, we showed that bumblebees are capable of responding to pollen availability, apparently by using visual assessment of pollen before landing on a flower as the basis for discriminatory foraging. Unlike previous studies, we found no evidence for discrimination among flowers on the basis of size, which was uncorrelated with pollen availability.},

Short-lived repellent scents are used to avoid probing flowers that have recently been depleted of nectar and/or pollen, and longer-term attractant scents to indicate particularly rewarding flowers. Previous research has indicated that bumblebees avoid flowers recently visited by themselves, conspecifics and congeners, while honeybees avoid flowers visited by themselves or conspecifics only. We found that both bumblebees and honeybees also avoided flowers previously visited by each other when foraging on Melilotus officinalis, that is, bumblebees avoided flowers recently visited by honeybees and vice versa. Twenty-four hours after a visit, this effect had worn off. Honeybees visited flowers that had been visited 24h previously more often than flowers that had never been visited. The same was not true for bumblebees, suggesting that foraging honeybees were also using long-term attractant scent marks, whilst bumblebees were not. Flowers previously visited by conspecifics were repellent to bumblebees and honeybees for ca.40min. During this time, nectar replenished in flowers. Honeybees were previously thought to use a volatile chemical (2-heptanone) as a repellent forage-marking scent. We suggest that they may be using a less volatile chemical odour to detect whether flowers have recently been visited, possibly in addition to 2-heptanone.},

  abstract  = {I challenge (1) the assumption that habitat patches are natural units of measurement for species richness, and (2) the assumption of distinct effects of habitat patch size and isolation on species richness. I propose a simpler view of the relationship between habitat distribution and species richness, the ‘habitat amount hypothesis’, and I suggest ways of testing it. The habitat amount hypothesis posits that, for habitat patches in a matrix of non-habitat, the patch size effect and the patch isolation effect are driven mainly by a single underlying process, the sample area effect. The hypothesis predicts that species richness in equal-sized sample sites should increase with the total amount of habitat in the ‘local landscape’ of the sample site, where the local landscape is the area within an appropriate distance of the sample site. It also predicts that species richness in a sample site is independent of the area of the particular patch in which the sample site is located (its ‘local patch’), except insofar as the area of that patch contributes to the amount of habitat in the local landscape of the sample site. The habitat amount hypothesis replaces two predictor variables, patch size and isolation, with a single predictor variable, habitat amount, when species richness is analysed for equal-sized sample sites rather than for unequal-sized habitat patches. Studies to test the hypothesis should ensure that ‘habitat’ is correctly defined, and the spatial extent of the local landscape is appropriate, for the species group under consideration. If supported, the habitat amount hypothesis would mean that to predict the relationship between habitat distribution and species richness: (1) distinguishing between patch-scale and landscape-scale habitat effects is unnecessary; (2) distinguishing between patch size effects and patch isolation effects is unnecessary; (3) considering habitat configuration independent of habitat amount is unnecessary; and (4) delineating discrete habitat patches is unnecessary.},

  abstract  = {Natural areas are important for wild bees in human-dominated landscapes as they provide permanent feeding and nesting resources. Understanding how bee communities vary with the amount of natural areas is thus key to guide conservation measures. This information, however, is largely lacking in montane tropical ecosystems. Here we explore to what extent the amount of forest area or forest edge (as landscape variables) influence the species richness and abundance of forest-edge associated bees in the Colombian Andes. In addition, we assess the effects of flower species richness and abundance (as local variables) to better understand the individual and interactive effects of forest conservation. Bees were surveyed along 20 forest edges differing in forest proportion and forest edge length within four spatial scales (250, 500, 1000 and 1500m radii). We conducted trait-specific analyses as bees with different traits associated to body size, sociality and nesting behavior might differ in their response to local and landscape variables. We found that overall bee species richness and abundance increased with an increasing proportion of forest within 1000m radius, but also with flower abundance. Similarly, the species richness and abundance of social, large and above-ground nesting bees increased with an increasing proportion of forest area, mainly within 500 and 1000m radii. However, only the abundance (not the species richness) of solitary and small bees were positively related to the proportion of forest within 1000m. Below-ground nesters did not respond to the individual effect of forest area at any spatial scale. Interactive effects between local and landscape variables were mainly found between flower richness and the proportion of forest. Forest edge length influenced only the abundance of solitary bees. These findings highlight the importance of conserving and/or restoring forest areas – at meaningful spatial scales – to promote diverse bee communities in montane tropical regions.},

  abstract  = {Human welfare depends on the amount and stability of agricultural production, as determined by crop yield and cultivated area. Yield increases asymptotically with the resources provided by farmers{\textquoteright} inputs and environmentally sensitive ecosystem services. Declining yield growth with increased inputs prompts conversion of more land to cultivation, but at the risk of eroding ecosystem services. To explore the interdependence of agricultural production and its stability on ecosystem services, we present and test a general graphical model, based on Jensen{\textquoteright}s inequality, of yield{\textendash}resource relations and consider implications for land conversion. For the case of animal pollination as a resource influencing crop yield, this model predicts that incomplete and variable pollen delivery reduces yield mean and stability (inverse of variability) more for crops with greater dependence on pollinators. Data collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations during 1961{\textendash}2008 support these predictions. Specifically, crops with greater pollinator dependence had lower mean and stability in relative yield and yield growth, despite global yield increases for most crops. Lower yield growth was compensated by increased land cultivation to enhance production of pollinator-dependent crops. Area stability also decreased with pollinator dependence, as it correlated positively with yield stability among crops. These results reveal that pollen limitation hinders yield growth of pollinator-dependent crops, decreasing temporal stability of global agricultural production, while promoting compensatory land conversion to agriculture. Although we examined crop pollination, our model applies to other ecosystem services for which the benefits to human welfare decelerate as the maximum is approached.},

The abundance and distribution of species tend to be linked, such that species declining in abundance often tend also to show declines in the number of sites they occupy, while species increasing in abundance tend also to be increasing in occupancy. Therefore, intraspecific abundance–occupancy relationships are commonly positive. 
2. The intraspecific pattern is mirrored by more general positive interspecific abundance–occupancy relationships: widespread species tend to be abundant, and narrowly distributed species rare.
3. Here, we review recent research on these patterns based on the flora and fauna of the British Isles. We assess their generality, describe what is currently known about their structure, and summarize the results of tests of the several hypotheses proposed to explain their existence. 
4. The positive form generally exhibited by abundance–occupancy relationships, intraspecific or interspecific, has consequences for several areas of applied ecology, including conservation, harvesting, biological invasions and biodiversity inventorying. These implications are discussed briefly.},

  abstract  = {Summary The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of ‘variance explained’ (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

The volume of nectar and weight of nectar sugar secreted per inflorescence were affected by the supply of each of the elements studied. Secretion in snapdragon was favoured by
the lower levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Secretion in red clover was best at the low and intermediate levels of phosphorus and at the intermediate level of potassium. Although a high concehtration of phosphorus or potassium in the mineral supply reduced secretion in both species, the threshold concentration for this inhibitory effect was higher in red clover than in snapdragon. High concentrations of potassium consistently reduced the sugar concentration of the nectar in both species. Flower number as well as quantity of secretion per inflorescerrce varied with nutritional treatment. For maximal production of nectar by the plant, the following conditions of fertility would appear desirable: A level of nitrogen low enough to avoid excessive vegetative growth, a level of phosphorus sufficient to promote good flowering, and a level of potassium which is neither low enough to limit growth severely nor high enough to reduce flower production.},

  abstract  = {A honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony adaptively controls the collection of water by its foragers, increasing it when high temperatures necesssitate evaporative cooling inside the hive and decreasing it when the danger of overheating passes. This study analyzes the mechanisms controlling water collection once it has begun, that is, how a colony's water collectors know whether to continue or stop their activity. M. Lindauer suggested that water collectors acquire information about their colony's need for more water by noting how easily they can unload their water to bees inside the hive. In support of this hypothesis, we found that a water collector's ease of unloading does indeed change when her colony's need for water changes. How does a water collector sense the ease of unloading? Multiple variables of the unloading experience change in relation to a colony's water need. Three time-based variables -- initial search time, total search time, and delivery time -- all change quite strongly. But what changes most strongly is the number of unloading rejections (refusals by receiver bees to take the water), suggesting that this is the primary index of ease of unloading. Why does a water collector's ease of unloading change when her colony's need for water changes? Evidently, what links these two variables is change in the number of water receivers. These are middle-aged bees that receive water just inside the hive entrance, then transport it deeper inside the hive, and finally smear it on the walls of cells or give it to other bees, or both. A colony increases the number of water receivers when its water need increases by having bees engaged in nectar reception and other tasks (and possibly also bees that are not working) switch to the task of water reception. Evidently the activation of additional water receivers does not strongly reduce the number of nectar receivers in a colony, since a colony can increase greatly its water collection without simultaneously decreasing its collection of rich nectar. This study provides a clear example of the way that the members of a social insect colony can use indirect indicators of their colony's labor needs to adaptively control the work that they perform.},

  abstract  = {A honey bee colony operates as a tightly integrated unit of behavioral action. One manifestation of this in the context of foraging is a colony's ability to adjust its selectivity among nectar sources in relation to its nutritional status. When a colony's food situation is good, it exploits only highly profitable patches of flowers, but when its situation is poor, a colony's foragers will exploit both highly profitable and less profitable flower patches. The nectar foragers in a colony acquire information about their colony's nutritional status by noting the difficulty of finding food storer bees to receive their nectar, rather than by evaluating directly the variables determining their colony's food situation: rate of nectar intake and amount of empty storage comb. (The food storer bees in a colony are the bees that collect nectar from returning foragers and store it in the honey combs. They are the age group (generally 12--18 day old bees) that is older than the nurse bees but younger than the foragers. Food storers make up approximately 20{\%} of a colony members.) The mathematical theory for the behavior of queues indicates that the waiting time experienced by nectar foragers before unloading to food storers (queue length) is a reliable and sensitive indicator of a colony's nutritional status. Queue length is automatically determined by the ratio of two rates which are directly related to a colony's nutritional condition: the rate of arrival of loaded nectar foragers at the hive (arrival rate) and the rate of arrival of empty food storers at the nectar delivery area (service rate). These two rates are a function of the colony's nectar intake rate and its empty comb area, respectively. Although waiting time conveys crucial information about the colony's nutritional status, it has not been molded by natural selection to serve this purpose. Unlike "signals", which are evolved specifically to convey information, this ``cue'' conveys information as an automatic by-product. Such cues may prove more important than signals in colony integration.},

Pollen foragers also had a more horizontal body position and higher inclination of stroke plane than measured previously for honey bees (probably nectar foragers). Thorax temperatures ranked pollen \&gt; nectar \&gt; water foragers, and higher flight metabolic rate could explain the higher thorax temperature of pollen foragers. Load mass did not affect hovering metabolic rate or wingbeat frequency in a regression-model experiment. However, using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) design, loaded pollen and nectar foragers (mean loads 27\% and 40\% of body mass, respectively) significantly increased metabolic rate by 6\%. Mean pollen loads of 18\% of body mass had no effect on wingbeat frequency, stroke amplitude, body angle or inclination of stroke plane, but increased the calculated mechanical power output by 16{\textendash}18\% (depending on the method of estimating drag). A rise in lift coefficient as bees carry loads without increasing wingbeat frequency or stroke amplitude (and only minimal increases in metabolic rate) suggests an increased use of unsteady power-generating mechanisms.},

The proportion of returning bees with a droplet on the tongue increased with increasing shade temperature (Ts), from essentially no bees at 20degreesC to 40\% of returning bees at 40degreesC. Pollen foragers carry relatively little fluid during the hottest periods, and pollen foraging decreased at high ambient temperatures. Thoracic temperatures of pollen collectors are significantly higher than thoracic temperatures of water and nectar gatherers at 40degreesC (46.13 vs 44degreesC). Additionally, water and nectar foragers with extruded droplets have slightly cooler heads and thoraces (38.94 and 43.22degreesC) than bees not extruding droplets (40.28 and 44.18degreesC). Wingloading and thoracic temperatures of bees are inversely correlated at high ambient temperatures (35degreesC) and this is probably caused by a higher propensity of heavier bees to extrude fluid, thus reducing thoracic temperature.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Climate change is predicted to result in increased occurrence and intensity of drought in many regions worldwide. By increasing plant physiological stress, drought is likely to affect the floral resources (flowers, nectar and pollen) that are available to pollinators. However, little is known about impacts of drought at the community level, nor whether plant community functional composition influences these impacts. To address these knowledge gaps, we investigated the impacts of drought on floral resources in calcareous grassland. Drought was simulated using rain shelters and the impacts were explored at multiple scales and on four different experimental plant communities varying in functional trait composition. First, we investigated the effects of drought on nectar production of three common wildflower species (Lathyrus pratensis, Onobrychis viciifolia and Prunella vulgaris). In the drought treatment, L. pratensis and P. vulgaris had a lower proportion of flowers containing nectar and O. viciifolia had fewer flowers per raceme. Second, we measured the effects of drought on the diversity and abundance of floral resources across plant communities. Drought reduced the abundance of floral units for all plant communities, irrespective of functional composition, and reduced floral species richness for two of the communities. Functional diversity did not confer greater resistance to drought in terms of maintaining floral resources, probably because the effects of drought were ubiquitous across component plant communities. The findings indicate that drought has a substantial impact on the availability of floral resources in calcareous grassland, which will have consequences for pollinator behaviour and populations.},

We evaluated effects on reproductive success of field bean (Vicia faba) and woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) using data from two study systems, both including study sites (1 km radius) with (flower strip sites) or without flower strips (control sites). To assess whether flower strips enhance pollination in the wider landscape, we compared the reproductive success between plants growing in field borders (>160 m to nearest flower strip) at flower strips sites and control sites. We also tested if flower strips reallocate pollination functions in the landscape. We did this by comparing the reproductive success of plants at flower strip sites, growing adjacent to the flower strips with plants growing in a more distant field border at the same site (>160 m). Finally, we tested if these potential effects depended on the heterogeneity of the landscape. In field borders without an adjacent flower strip, plant reproductive success was unaffected by the presence of a flower strip at the site, and increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity independently of site type (flower strip vs. control). In contrast, adjacent to the flower strips, reproductive success declined with increasing landscape heterogeneity, resulting in a positive net effect of adjacent flower strips in homogeneous landscapes and a negative effect in heterogeneous landscapes. Our results show that while decreasing landscape heterogeneity may impair pollination in homogeneous landscapes, this can be locally mitigated by sowing flower strips. However, in heterogeneous landscapes, flower strips may instead reduce pollination of adjacent plants.},

  abstract  = {Assessments of environmental drivers that regulate the functional composition of various organisms have become more frequent in the ecological literature, as this approach establishes a more direct connection between community structure and ecosystem functions. Bee response traits, such as sociality, body size, nest location, nest behaviour, and dietary specialization, have been reported in empirical studies that examine the role of land use intensity in functional diversity. However, empirical studies include different descriptors measured at different spatial scales, producing poor generalizations. Processes operating at different scales may have different effects depending on the response traits considered in the analysis. In this meta-analysis, we provide a quantitative assessment of the role that the structural complexity of habitats at local and landscape scales plays in the richness and abundance patterns of bees, considering different response traits. As indicated through this meta-analysis, the descriptors of structural complexity at the local scale explained more of the richness and abundance of bees with distinct response traits than the descriptors at the landscape scale. In addition, high management intensity has a negative effect on the different response traits. Below-ground nesting bees and social bees showed different abundance trends, which suggest a mechanism denominated ‘response diversity’. This result suggests that the adoption of hybrid management strategies at the local scale could support the richness and abundance of different bees with distinct response traits in agroecosystems. These distinct response traits can be an important ecological pattern that contributes to the development of management strategies that maintain, in space and time, bees with distinct response traits. However, we should analyse the communities in terms of clusters of response traits, considering the possible synergies and trade-offs between these traits.},

  abstract  = {Small semi-natural and natural habitats in agricultural landscapes are important for biodiversity. With modern and more intensive agricultural practices they have become smaller (less than 1600m2) and more isolated study which also affects ecosystem functions. Most ecosystem function studies using field experiments focus on a single function. Here, we investigate three functions in the same landscape at the same time. We investigated how local (trees, shrubs and grass-cover in small remnant habitats) and landscape factors (amount of and distance from key habitats i.e. forest and semi-natural grasslands) affect pollination, biological pest control and seed predation. We applied a multifunctional approach using different organisms to analyze pollination success (Primula veris), predation on aphid pests (Rhopalosiphum padi) and seed predation (of Helianthus annuus). A set-up of 3 different experiments were placed in situ on 12 midfield islets. Pollination was more affected by local factors than landscape factors, although pollination success was improved by a smaller proportions of surrounding crop fields. Seed predation was higher on islets with more surrounding forest and also with more trees on the habitat, especially close to shrubs, compared to more open areas of habitat. Predation on aphids decreased on midfield islets with a larger amount of nearby forest but was positively affected by increasing local tree cover on the habitat. We show that managing semi-open habitats that are connected to other natural or semi-natural habitats can improve pollination success and biological pest and weed control, thus potentially increasing yield in surrounding crop fields.},

  abstract  = {As the planet cooled from peak warmth in the early Cenozoic, extensive Northern Hemisphere ice sheets developed by 2.6Ma ago, leading to changes in the circulation of both the atmosphere and oceans. From ~2.6 to ~1.0Ma ago, ice sheets came and went about every 41ka, in pace with cycles in the tilt of Earth’s axis, but for the past 700ka, glacial cycles have been longer, lasting ~100ka, separated by brief, warm interglaciations, when sea level and ice volumes were close to present. The cause of the shift from 41ka to 100ka glacial cycles is still debated. During the penultimate interglaciation, ~130 to ~120ka ago, solar energy in summer in the Arctic was greater than at any time subsequently. As a consequence, Arctic summers were ~5°C warmer than at present, and almost all glaciers melted completely except for the Greenland Ice Sheet, and even it was reduced in size substantially from its present extent. With the loss of land ice, sea level was about 5m higher than present, with the extra melt coming from both Greenland and Antarctica as well as small glaciers. The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) peaked ~21ka ago, when mean annual temperatures over parts of the Arctic were as much as 20°C lower than at present. Ice recession was well underway 16ka ago, and most of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets had melted by 6ka ago. Solar energy reached a summer maximum (9% higher than at present) ~11ka ago and has been decreasing since then, primarily in response to the precession of the equinoxes. The extra energy elevated early Holocene summer temperatures throughout the Arctic 1–3°C above 20th century averages, enough to completely melt many small glaciers throughout the Arctic, although the Greenland Ice Sheet was only slightly smaller than at present. Early Holocene summer sea ice limits were substantially smaller than their 20th century average, and the flow of Atlantic water into the Arctic Ocean was substantially greater. As summer solar energy decreased in the second half of the Holocene, glaciers re-established or advanced, sea ice expanded, and the flow of warm Atlantic water into the Arctic Ocean diminished. Late Holocene cooling reached its nadir during the Little Ice Age (about 1250–1850 AD), when sun-blocking volcanic eruptions and perhaps other causes added to the orbital cooling, allowing most Arctic glaciers to reach their maximum Holocene extent. During the warming of the past century, glaciers have receded throughout the Arctic, terrestrial ecosystems have advanced northward, and perennial Arctic Ocean sea ice has diminished. Here we review the proxies that allow reconstruction of Quaternary climates and the feedbacks that amplify climate change across the Arctic. We provide an overview of the evolution of climate from the hot-house of the early Cenozoic through its transition to the ice-house of the Quaternary, with special emphasis on the anomalous warmth of the middle Pliocene, early Quaternary warm times, the Mid Pleistocene transition, warm interglaciations of marine isotope stages 11, 5e, and 1, the stage 3 interstadial, and the peak cold of the last glacial maximum.},

Under a variety of conditions, bees exhibited a small but reliable tendency to avoid revisits to locations that they had visited earlier during the experimental trial. These results replicate those of Brown and Demas (1994), who concluded that bees use working memory to discriminate previously visited locations from those not yet visited. The present experiments included procedures that allowed alternatives to this explanation to be more completely ruled out. The extent of spatial working memory performance exhibited by honeybees in these experiments appears to be limited by a process other than working memory capacity, perhaps the ability of bees to discriminate among several locations in close proximity to one another.},

  abstract  = {(1) We investigate properties of a model of predator distribution in relation to prey abundance, when the predation process is subject to: (i) non-negligible handling time and mutual interference; (ii) predator learning; (iii) intake rate maximization by individual predators. The model is a development of that of Bernstein, Kacelnik & Krebs (1988). (2) The independent variables are between-patch travel cost and structure of the environment. The outcome of the model is described in relation to the predictions of the ideal free distribution (IFD). We consider both the numerical distribution of predators and the mortality rate imposed on the prey population. (3) When travel cost is small, prey depletion is slow and interference is moderate, predators conform to the predictions of the IFD and prey mortality is density-dependent. (4) As travel cost is increased, rate-maximizing predators become more sedentary and the population settles at distributions far from the IFD. In common with all other disturbances of the predation process that impair the correlation between prey and predator densities, this causes mortality to approach density independence and later negative density dependence. (5) In semi-continuous environments where prey density is correlated between neighbouring patches, the slower the spatial rate of variation in prey density (the coarser the environmental grain), the poorer is the adjustment to the IFD. This effect is due to the predators' need for learning: when the environmental sample experienced within the reach of each individual predator is unrepresentative of the global average prey density (as it happens when the environmental grain is very coarse relative to migration range of predators), the predators cannot learn the global distribution of foraging opportunities and fail to take the policy that optimizes individual intake rate. (6) We discuss how these findings might account for observed patterns of mortality in real insects populations.},

  abstract  = {Honeybees are unique in that they are the only social insects that are known to recruit nest mates using the waggle dance. This waggle dance is used by successful foragers to convey information about both the direction and distance to food sources. Nest mates can use this spatial information, increasing their chances of locating the food source. But how effective is the bees' dance communication? Previous work has shown that dancing does not benefit a honeybee colony under all foraging conditions and that the benefits of dancing are small. We used an individual-based simulation model to investigate under which foraging conditions it pays to dance. We compared the net nectar intake of 3 types of colonies: 1) colonies that use dance communication; 2) colonies that did dance but could not use the dance's spatial information; and 3) colonies that did not dance. Our results show that dancing is beneficial when the probability of independent discovery of food sources is low. Low independent discovery rates occur when patches are very small or very far away. Under these conditions, dancing is beneficial as only a single individual needs to find a patch for the whole colony to benefit. The main benefit of the honeybee's dance communication, however, seems to be that it enables the colony to forage at the most profitable patches only, ignoring forage patches that are of low quality. Thus, dancing allows the colony to rapidly exploit high-quality patches, thereby preventing both intra- and interspecific competitors from using that same patch.},

  abstract  = {Social animals that bring resources to a central place have commonly been used to test the predictions of optimal foraging models. Such animals are amenable to test because they do not themselves reproduce, and so we might expect them to be selected to maximise some measure of input of food to the colony. Several currencies have been proposed to predict behaviour, such as net rate, efficiency, and the ratio of the mortality rate to energy gain rate. Observations on social animals, especially bees, show mixed support for each currency. Here, we examine how these currencies can be united by considering the expected lifetime input of energy to the colony in a representative study of patch residence time. This currency explains partial loads because it leads to the prediction that the energy that a forager delivers to the colony over its lifetime is maximised by returning to the colony after a critical amount has been collected, even if energy is gained at a constant rate. We show that the extent to which foraging carries a greater mortality risk than travelling controls whether this currency makes similar predictions to net rate or to efficiency. We assess the evidence that bee behaviour actually maximises this currency and argue that mortality risk at resource sites is likely to be a critical determinant of foraging strategies in central-place foragers.},

Social bees provide a good model for this and, whilst there are published descriptions of their behaviour on initial learning flights close to the colony, it is still unclear how bees find floral resources over hundreds of metres and how these flights become directed foraging trips. We investigated the spatial ecology of exploration by radar tracking bumblebees, and comparing the flight trajectories of bees with differing experience. The bees left the colony within a day or two of eclosion and flew in complex loops of ever-increasing size around the colony, exhibiting Lévy-flight characteristics constituting an optimal searching strategy. This mathematical pattern can be used to predict how animals exploring individually might exploit a patchy landscape. The bees’ groundspeed, maximum displacement from the nest and total distance travelled on a trip increased significantly with experience. More experienced bees flew direct paths, predominantly flying upwind on their outward trips although forage was available in all directions. The flights differed from those of naïve honeybees: they occurred at an earlier age, showed more complex looping, and resulted in earlier returns of pollen to the colony. In summary bumblebees learn to find home and food rapidly, though phases of orientation, learning and searching were not easily separable, suggesting some multi-tasking.},

  abstract  = {Social bees are central place foragers collecting floral resources from the surrounding landscape, but little is known about the probability of a scouting bee finding a particular flower patch. We therefore developed a software tool, BEESCOUT, to theoretically examine how bees might explore a landscape and distribute their scouting activities over time and space. An image file can be imported, which is interpreted by the model as a “forage map” with certain colours representing certain crops or habitat types as specified by the user. BEESCOUT calculates the size and location of these potential food sources in that landscape relative to a bee colony. An individual-based model then determines the detection probabilities of the food patches by bees, based on parameter values gathered from the flight patterns of radar-tracked honeybees and bumblebees. Various “search modes” describe hypothetical search strategies for the long-range exploration of scouting bees. The resulting detection probabilities of forage patches can be used as input for the recently developed honeybee model BEEHAVE, to explore realistic scenarios of colony growth and death in response to different stressors. In example simulations, we find that detection probabilities for food sources close to the colony fit empirical data reasonably well. However, for food sources further away no empirical data are available to validate model output. The simulated detection probabilities depend largely on the bees’ search mode, and whether they exchange information about food source locations. Nevertheless, we show that landscape structure and connectivity of food sources can have a strong impact on the results. We believe that BEESCOUT is a valuable tool to better understand how landscape configurations and searching behaviour of bees affect detection probabilities of food sources. It can also guide the collection of relevant data and the design of experiments to close knowledge gaps, and provides a useful extension to the BEEHAVE honeybee model, enabling future users to explore how landscape structure and food availability affect the foraging decisions and patch visitation rates of the bees and, in consequence, to predict colony development and survival.},

  abstract  = {A notable increase in failure of managed European honeybee Apis mellifera L. colonies has been reported in various regions in recent years. Although the underlying causes remain unclear, it is likely that a combination of stressors act together, particularly varroa mites and other pathogens, forage availability and potentially pesticides. It is experimentally challenging to address causality at the colony scale when multiple factors interact. In silico experiments offer a fast and cost-effective way to begin to address these challenges and inform experiments. However, none of the published bee models combine colony dynamics with foraging patterns and varroa dynamics. We have developed a honeybee model, BEEHAVE, which integrates colony dynamics, population dynamics of the varroa mite, epidemiology of varroa-transmitted viruses and allows foragers in an agent-based foraging model to collect food from a representation of a spatially explicit landscape. We describe the model, which is freely available online (www.beehave-model.net). Extensive sensitivity analyses and tests illustrate the model's robustness and realism. Simulation experiments with various combinations of stressors demonstrate, in simplified landscape settings, the model's potential: predicting colony dynamics and potential losses with and without varroa mites under different foraging conditions and under pesticide application. We also show how mitigation measures can be tested. Synthesis and applications. BEEHAVE offers a valuable tool for researchers to design and focus field experiments, for regulators to explore the relative importance of stressors to devise management and policy advice and for beekeepers to understand and predict varroa dynamics and effects of management interventions. We expect that scientists and stakeholders will find a variety of applications for BEEHAVE, stimulating further model development and the possible inclusion of other stressors of potential importance to honeybee colony dynamics.},

Although male gametophyte performance primarily involves cellular processes, an ecological analogy may expose insights into the nature and implications of male gametophyte success. We elaborate this analogy theoretically and present empirical examples that illustrate associated insights. Specifically, we consider pollen loads on stigmas as localised populations subject to density-independent mortality and density-dependent processes as they traverse complex stylar environments. Different combinations of the timing of pollen-tube access to limiting stylar resources (simultaneous or sequential), the tube distribution among resources (repulsed or random) and the timing of density-independent mortality relative to competition (before or after) create signature relations of mean pollen-tube success and its variation among pistils to pollen receipt. Using novel nonlinear regression analyses (two-moment regression), we illustrate contrasting relations for two species, demonstrating that variety in these relations is a feature of reproductive diversity among angiosperms, rather than merely a theoretical curiosity. Thus, the details of male gametophyte ecology should shape sporophyte reproductive success and hence the dynamics and structure of angiosperm populations.},

Recent work has revealed that signals originating from the pod may also act to coordinate grain filling and regulate the reallocation of reserves from damaged seeds to those that have retained viability. In this review we consider the evidence that pods can regulate seed growth and maturation, particularly in members of the Brassicaceae family, and explore how the timing and duration of pod development might be manipulated to enhance either the quantity of crop yield or its nutritional properties.},

  abstract  = {The number of pods per plant and the number of seeds per pod are the most variable yield components in winter oilseed rape (WOSR). Both the number of ovules per pod and the potential for the ovule to develop into a mature seed may depend on pod position in the plant architecture and time of appearance. The complex developmental pattern of WOSR makes it difficult to analyse. The objectives of this study were to investigate the variability of the following yield components (a) ovules/pod, (b) seeds/pod, and (c) pods/axis in relation to two explanatory variables. These two variables include (1) flower and inflorescence position and (2) time of pod appearance, linked to the effect of assimilate availability. Field experiments were conducted with the variety Mendel. Different trophic states were created by clipping the main stem or ramifications. The number and position of flowers that bloomed within the inflorescence were recorded based on observations every two to three days throughout the flowering season. On the control plants, for the main stem we observed that the number of ovules per pod decreased for a few ranks and then tended to increase and again to decrease at the end. On ramification R1 and R4, the number of ovules increased at first, and then remained constant with the pod rank. Furthermore, the number of ovules per pod remained constant along the inflorescence on the other ramifications and increased with ramifications from top to bottom. The number of seeds per pod did not vary with the pod rank at the basal positions on inflorescences and decreased afterwards along the inflorescence. The clipping of the main stem or ramifications increased the number of ovules per pod, seeds per pod and pods per axis. The number of ovules and seeds per pod did not vary with the time of pod appearance for the pods located at normalised rank 0.01–0.1. However, the number of ovules and seeds per pod can be impacted by the time of pod appearance on the plant scale. Thus, our results indicate that the amount of available assimilates was the primary determinant of pod and seed production during the flowering period. The distribution of resources was significantly affected by both the positions of pods within an inflorescence and the position of inflorescences within a plant.},

While it is clear that urbanization impacts species abundance and diversity, direct effects of urban land use on animal reproductive success are rarely documented. Here, we show that urban land use is linked to long-term colony reproductive output in a key pollinator. We reared colonies from wild-caught bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) queens, placed them at sites characterized by varying degrees of urbanization from inner city to rural farmland and monitored the production of sexual offspring across the entire colony cycle. Our land-use cluster analysis identified three site categories, and this categorization was a strong predictor of colony performance. Crucially, colonies in the two clusters characterized by urban development produced more sexual offspring than those in the cluster dominated by agricultural land. These colonies also reached higher peak size, had more food stores, encountered fewer parasite invasions and survived for longer. Our results show a link between urbanization and bumblebee colony reproductive success, supporting the theory that urban areas provide a refuge for pollinator populations in an otherwise barren agricultural landscape.},

However, they have mostly been studied in isolation and how they interactively shape crop yield remains largely unexplored. Using controlled field experiments, we found strong synergistic effects of insect pollination and simulated pest control on yield quantity and quality. Their joint effect increased yield by 23\%, with synergistic effects contributing 10\%, while their single contributions were 7\% and 6\%, respectively. The potential economic benefit for a farmer from the synergistic effects (12\%) was 1.8 times greater than their individual contributions (7\% each). We show that the principal underlying mechanism was a pronounced pest-induced reduction in flower lifetime, resulting in a strong reduction in the number of pollinator visits a flower receives during its lifetime. Our findings highlight the importance of non-additive interactions among ecosystem services (ES) when valuating, mapping or predicting them and reveal fundamental implications for ecosystem management and policy aimed at maximizing ES for sustainable agriculture.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Many mutualisms are taken advantage of by organisms that take rewards from their partners but provide no benefit in return. In the absence of traits that limit exploitation, facultative exploiters (partners that can either exploit or cooperate) are widely predicted by mutualism theory to choose an exploitative strategy, potentially threatening mutualism stability. However, it is unknown whether facultative exploiters choose to exploit, and, if so, make this choice because it is the most beneficial strategy for them. We explored these questions in a subalpine plant-insect community in which individuals of several bumble bee species visit flowers both “legitimately” (entering via the flower opening, picking up and depositing pollen, and hence behaving mutualistically) and via nectar robbing (creating holes through corollas or using an existing hole, bypassing stigmas and anthers). We applied foraging theory to (1) quantify handling costs, benefits and foraging efficiencies incurred by three bumble bee species as they visited flowers legitimately or robbed nectar in cage experiments, and (2) determine whether these efficiencies matched the food handling tactics these bee species employed in the field. Relative efficiencies of legitimate and robbing tactics depended on the combination of bee and plant species. In some cases (Bombus mixtus visiting Corydalis caseana or Mertensia ciliata), the robbing tactic permitted more efficient nectar removal. As both mutualism and foraging theory would predict, in the field, B. mixtus visiting C. caseana were observed more frequently robbing than foraging legitimately. However, for Bombus flavifrons visiting M. ciliata, the expectation from mutualism theory did not hold: legitimate visitation was the more efficient tactic. Legitimate visitation to M. ciliata was in fact more frequently observed in free-flying B. flavifrons. Free-flying B. mixtus also frequently visited M. ciliata flowers legitimately. This may reflect lower nectar volumes in robbed than unrobbed flowers in the field. These results suggest that a foraging ecology perspective is informative to the choice of tactics facultative exploiters make. In contrast, the simple expectation that exploiters should always have an advantage, and hence could threaten mutualism persistence unless they are deterred or punished, may not be broadly applicable.},

  year      = {2018},
  volume    = {In press},
  abstract  = {1. Intensive agricultural management negatively affects both natural enemies of pests and pollinators. Such management also has the potential to adversely affect the ecosystem services that these communities confer. Organic management has been proposed as an alternative method to mitigate such problems by restoring the services provided by arthropod communities. 
2. We evaluated the effect of organic management on two ecosystem services provided by arthropods in apple orchards: pollination and biological control. We used relative decrease in colonies to assess biological control of the major apple aphid pest, and measured pollination through fruit set, number of seeds per apple and pollinator visitation. Additionally, we monitored the organisms responsible for pollination and biological control services and established the impact of pollination on apple quality. 
3. Our results show a strong effect of organic management on biological control and on the temporal dynamic of natural enemy-pest interactions. Parameters such as aphid colony suppression, first and repeated occurrence of natural enemies, natural enemy species evenness and natural enemy abundance were significantly higher in organic compared to conventional orchards. Predatory bugs were the natural enemies best-affected by organic management and played a key role in early predation of aphids preventing colony growth. 
4. In this instance, pollination was not influenced by organic management. It is likely due to the temporal scale at which this service is delivered, a scale that differs greatly from biological control, combined with differences in the dispersal capacity of the organisms involved. Fruit weight, calcium, potassium and magnesium content were positively affected by pollination success. 
5. Synthesis and applications. We found that organic management in apple orchards preserves the local natural enemy community, and specifically predatory bug populations, essential for early aphid colony suppression. Our results suggest that, in conventional orchards, local management options that decrease or even eliminate pesticide use early in the season would increase the biological control of aphids. This would lead to reduction in apple damage at harvest. Our results on pollination success indicate that the implementation of organic management at orchard scale does not enhance pollination services for apple growers.},

This tutorial provides a practical introduction to fitting LMMs in a Bayesian framework using the probabilistic programming language Stan. We choose Stan (rather than WinBUGS or JAGS) because it provides an elegant and scalable framework for fitting models in most of the standard applications of LMMs. We ease the reader into fitting increasingly complex LMMs, using a two-condition repeated measures self-paced reading study.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Experimental studies of evolution performed in nature and the associated demonstration of rapid evolution, observable on a time scale of months to years, were an acclaimed novelty in the 1980–1990s. Contemporary evolution is now considered ordinary and is an integrated feature of many areas of research. This shift from extraordinary to ordinary reflects a change in the perception of evolution. It was formerly thought of as a historical process, perceived through the footprints left in the fossil record or living organisms. It is now seen as a contemporary process that acts in real time. Here we review how this shift occurred and its consequences for fields as diverse as wildlife management, conservation biology, and ecosystems ecology. Incorporating contemporary evolution in these fields has caused old questions to be recast, changed the answers, caused new and previously inconceivable questions to be addressed, and inspired the development of new subdisciplines. We argue further that the potential of contemporary evolution has yet to be fulfilled. Incorporating evolutionary dynamics in any research program can provide a better assessment of how and why organisms and communities came to be as they are than is attainable without an explicit treatment of these dynamics.},

  abstract  = {A long-standing question in ecology is how species interactions are structured within communities. Although evolutionary theory predicts close size matching between floral nectar tube depth and pollinator proboscis length of interacting species, such size matching has seldom been shown and explained in multispecies assemblages. Here, we investigated the degree of size matching among Asteraceae and their pollinators and its relationship with foraging efficiency. The majority of pollinators, especially Hymenoptera, choose plant species on which they had high foraging efficiencies. When proboscides were shorter than nectar tubes, foraging efficiency rapidly decreased because of increased handling time. When proboscides were longer than nectar tubes, a decreased nectar reward rather than an increased handling time made shallow flowers more inefficient to visit. Altogether, this led to close size matching. Overall, our results show the importance of nectar reward and handling time as drivers of plant–pollinator network structure.},

  abstract  = {Insect pollinators such as bumblebees play a vital role in many ecosystems, so it is important to understand their foraging movements on a landscape scale. We used harmonic radar to record the natural foraging behaviour of Bombus terrestris audax workers over their entire foraging career. Every flight ever made outside the nest by four foragers was recorded. Our data reveal where the bees flew and how their behaviour changed with experience, at an unprecedented level of detail. We identified how each bee’s flights fit into two categories—which we named exploration and exploitation flights—examining the differences between the two types of flight and how their occurrence changed over the course of the bees’ foraging careers. Exploitation of learned resources takes place during efficient, straight trips, usually to a single foraging location, and is seldom combined with exploration of other areas. Exploration of the landscape typically occurs in the first few flights made by each bee, but our data show that further exploration flights can be made throughout the bee’s foraging career. Bees showed striking levels of variation in how they explored their environment, their fidelity to particular patches, ratio of exploration to exploitation, duration and frequency of their foraging bouts. One bee developed a straight route to a forage patch within four flights and followed this route exclusively for six days before abandoning it entirely for a closer location; this second location had not been visited since her first exploratory flight nine days prior. Another bee made only rare exploitation flights and continued to explore widely throughout its life; two other bees showed more frequent switches between exploration and exploitation. Our data shed light on the way bumblebees balance exploration of the environment with exploitation of resources and reveal extreme levels of variation between individuals.},

  abstract  = {Hybrid cotton (Gossypium spp.) pollination needs to be supplemented with honey bee (Apis mellfera L.) colonies. However, the relative importance of this supplemental pollination at specified time intervals during cotton bloom has not been determined. Therefore, our study was conducted to determine the quantity and quality of hybrid seed produced as a result of pollination during four consecutive, equal degree-day (DD) periods. Four hybrid cotton seed production fields were established in Lubbock County, Texas. Accumulated DD (base temperature = 15 °C) were recorded for each field and divided into four equal periods within fields. Native and honey bee visitation was monitored every 2 d by counting the numbers observed per 100 flowers on the A-line. All cotton bolls were hand harvested and sorted by date of bloom. Following harvesting, ginning, and delinting, seeds were counted and weighed, and percent germination was determined. Although the native and honey bee visitation level was adequate throughout each DD period, linear regression analyses indicate that coefficients of determination (r2) were low for (i) percent boll set and number of bees (native and honey bees), and (ii) number of seeds per boll and mean number of bees (native and honey bees). Pollination during the earlier DD periods resulted in higher percent germination, larger number of seeds per boll, and higher seed weight than seeds resulting from pollination during the latter bloom periods. We conclude that with proper honey bee management and pollination timing, the quality of hybrid seed produced will be improved by using only that from the first half of the bloom period},

  abstract  = {Production of hybrid seed canola requires the transfer of pollen from hermaphroditic (‘male’) to male-sterile (‘female’) plants, facilitated by managed pollinators (honey and leafcutter bees) and wild pollinators. I assessed pollinators in fields of hybrid seed canola located in Southern Alberta to determine what behaviours and conditions could enhance pollen transfer between male and female plants. I found that managed species were the most common pollinators, that all pollinators exhibited floral constancy to morph (male or female), and that pollinator type, time on flower, pollen on body, and flower of origin influenced pollination effectiveness. Pollinator movement between male and female flowers was positively affected by densities of conspecific pollinators, taxon richness, and relative floral profit. While hybrid seed canola morphs are sexually dimorphic, sufficient quantities of managed pollinators should reduce floral constancy. Wild pollinators can contribute to cross-pollination indirectly by increasing managed pollinator movement via increased diversity.},

The model shows that even when there is a resource trade-off between size and number of offspring within individuals, positive correlations between size and number may occur among individuals due to individual variation in resources. Such positive correlations imply that parental resource status affects the fitness-maximizing offspring size, in contrast to the predictions of the standard Smith-Fretwell model. I show that parental resource status affects the fitness-maximizing offspring size whenever the size-number fitness function is nonhomogeneous in offspring number. This condition implies some sort of density-dependent interactions among offspring, although it is possible to have either positive or negative sib interactions in fitness functions that are homogeneous in offspring number. In the latter case offspring size should be insensitive to parental resource status. I explore several cases including linear (Smith-Fretwell), nonlinear but homogeneous, and nonhomogeneous seed-number functions with independent size and number effects, as well as models with interacting offspring size-number effects. I briefly review the plant literature on offspring density dependence and seed-size variation with parental resource status. Some suggestions for testing the ideas with plants and some alternative explanations of positive seed-size/plant-size and seed-size/seed-number correlations are discussed.},

  abstract  = {In grain crops, total sink capacity is usually analysed in terms of two components, seed number and individual seed weight. Seed number and potential individual seed weight are established at a similar timing, around the flowering period, and seed weight at maturity is highly correlated with the potential established earlier. It is known that, within a species, available resources during the seed set period are distributed between both yield components, resulting in a trade-off between seed number and seed weight. Here we tested if this concept could apply for interspecific comparisons, where combinations of numbers and size across species could be related to the total available resources being either allocated to more seed or larger potential individual seed weight during the seed set period. Based on this, species differences in seed weight should be related to resource availability per seed around the period when seed number is determined. Resource availability per seed was estimated as the rate of increase in aboveground biomass per seed around the period of seed set. Data from 15 crop species differing in plant growth, seed number, seed weight and seed composition were analysed from available literature. Because species differed in seed composition, seed weight was analysed following an energy requirement approach. There was an interspecific trade-off relationship between seed number per unit of land area and seed weight (r = 0.92; F(1, 13) = 32.9; n = 15; P < 0.001). Seed weight of different species was positively correlated (r = 0.90; F(1, 13) = 52.9; n = 15; P < 0.001) with resource availability per seed around the seed set period. This correlation included contrasting species like quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa; ~100000 seeds m-2, ~4 mg equivalent-glucose seed-1) or peanut (Arachis hypogaea; ~800 seeds m-2, ~1000 mg equivalent-glucose seed-1). Seed number and individual seed weight combinations across species were related and could be explained considering resource availability when plants are adjusting their seed number to the growth environment and seeds are establishing their storage capacity. Available resources around the seed set period are proportionally allocated to produce either many small seeds or few larger seeds depending on the particular species.},

  abstract  = {Under sexual conflict, males evolve traits to increase their mating and reproductive success that impose costs on females. Females evolve counteradaptations to resist males and reduce those costs. Sexual harassment is a form of sexual conflict in which males make repeated, costly attempts to mate. Costs to female foraging or predation risk have been measured in several species, but quantitative measurements of direct fitness costs are rare. In the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius; Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), males harass females, and females resist all mating attempts. We placed bees in large, outdoor cages with various male-biased sex ratios. Harassment rate, nest progression, offspring production, temperature, and food availability were measured daily for 7 days. Harassment rates were highest at intermediate sex ratios. Harassment reduced the number of foraging trips and increased the duration of foraging trips made by females. Females produced offspring at a slower rate when subjected to higher rates of harassment. This shows a direct link from sex ratio to harassment to female fitness under natural conditions. We also discuss an alternative explanation that female resistance is a mechanism for mate choice for high-quality males, which would require that indirect benefits accrue through either daughters or grandsons, because all sons in haplodiploid species arise from unfertilized eggs.},

  abstract  = {In ecology, recent technological advances and long-term data studies now provide longitudinal interaction data (e.g. between individuals or species). Most often, time is the parameter along which interactions evolve but any other one-dimensional gradient (temperature, altitude, depth, humidity, etc.) can be considered. These data can be modelled through a sequence of different snapshots of an evolving ecological network, i.e. a dynamic network. Here, we present how the dynamic stochastic block model approach developed by Matias & Miele (Matias & Miele In press J. R. Stat. Soc. B (doi:10.1111/rssb.12200)) can capture the complexity and dynamics of these networks. First, we analyse a dynamic contact network of ants and we observe a clear high-level assembly with some variations in time at the individual level. Second, we explore the structure of a food web evolving during a year and we detect a stable predator–prey organization but also seasonal differences in the prey assemblage. Our approach, based on a rigorous statistical method implemented in the R package dynsbm, can pave the way for exploration of evolving ecological networks.},

In this paper we develop a methodology for reconstructing endogenous (or deterministic) dynamics from ecological time series. Our method consists of fitting a response surface to the yearly population change as a function of lagged population densities. Using the version of the model that includes two lags, we fitted time—series data for 14 insect and 22 vertebrate populations. The 14 insect populations were classified as: unregulated (1 case), exponentially stable (three cases), damped oscillations (six cases), limit cycles (one case), quasiperiodic oscillations (two cases), and chaos (one case). The vertebrate examples exhibited a similar spectrum of dynamics, although there were no cases of chaos. We tested the results of the response—surface methodology by calculating autocorrelation functions for each time series. Autocorrelation patterns were in agreement with our findings of periodic behaviors (damped oscillations, limit cycles, and quasiperiodicity). On the basis of these results, we conclude that the complete spectrum of dynamical behaviors, ranging from exponential stability to chaos, is likely to be found among natural populations.},

The grasslands greatly differed in the number of honey bee colonies within a radius of 2 km and were surrounded by agricultural habitats. The number of flower-visiting honey bees on both potted mustard plants and small grassland patches declined with increasing distance from the nearest apiary and was almost zero at a distance of 1.5--2.0 km. Wild bees were observed visiting 57 plant species, whereas honey bees visited only 24 plant species. Percentage resource overlap between honey bees and wild bees was 45.5{\%}, and Hurlbert's index of niche overlap was 3.1. In total, 1849 wild bees from 98 species were recorded on the calcareous grasslands. Neither species richness nor abundance of wild bees were negatively correlated with the density of honey bee colonies (within a radius of 2 km) or the density of flower-visiting honey bees per site. Abundance of flower- visiting wild bees was correlated only with the percentage cover of flowering plants. In 240 trap nests, 1292 bee nests with 6066 brood cells were found. Neither the number of bee species nor the number of brood cells per grassland was significantly correlated with the density of honey bees. Significant correlations were found only between the number of brood cells and the percentage cover of shrubs. The number of nest entrances of ground-nesting bees per square metre was not correlated with the density of honey bees but was negatively correlated with the cover of vegetation. Interspecific competition by honey bees for food resources was not shown to be a significant factor determining abundance and species richness of wild bees.},

Average honey production was -70, -17, +28, and +67 g/d for the least to most crowded bees, respectively. More crowded bees produced less brood, but the difference was less marked than in winter. A final experiment measured the effects of adding hive space that did not contain comb (n = 27). Of three treatments, colonies with five combs in a 25-liter hive produced the most honey (105 g/d), and colonies with additional space and combs (10 combs in a 47-liter hive) produced the least (29 g/d).

  abstract = {Pollinating insects are not only important in wild plant pollination, but also in the production of a large number of crops. Oilseed rape production is increasing globally due to demands for biofuels which may have impacts on pollinating insects which visit the crop and on the pollination services delivered to co-flowering wild plants. In this study, we tested (1) the degree of pollinator sharing between oilseed rape and native wild plants in field margins and hedgerows and (2) the effects of oilseed rape on the quality of pollination service delivered to these wild plants. We found large overlap between flower visitors of wild plants and oilseed rape, but the composition of species overlap differed with respect to each wild plant species. Nearly all individual visitors caught on both the crop and foraging on wild species carried crop pollen, but more than half the insects also carried pollen from wild plants. However, very little oilseed rape pollen was deposited on wild plant stigmas. This shows that (1) oilseed rape overlaps in pollinator niche with most co-flowering wild plants, and (2) crop pollen deposition on wild plant stigmas is low which may indicate that it is unlikely to cause reductions in seed set of wild plants, although this was not measured here. Furthermore, wild plants in field margins and hedgerows are important sources of alternative forage for pollinating insects even when a crop is mass flowering, and we suggest maintenance and augmentation of field margins and hedgerows to provide alternative forage for pollinator conservation to continue provision of pollination services to both crops and wild plants.},

  abstract  = {Global declines in pollinating insects have been linked with agricultural intensification and land-use change. Increased production of novel crops for bioenergy is causing changes in agricultural practice, but the effects on different pollinating taxa have not yet been quantified. However, the major pollinating groups (social bees, solitary bees, hoverflies and butterflies) are likely to respond differently to changes in land use and shifts in crop cultivation patterns. We assessed the impacts of two bioenergy crops, oilseed rape Brassica napus L. and Miscanthus Miscanthus X giganteus on (i) the diversity and abundance of four taxonomic groups of pollinating insects, (ii) insect community composition, (iii) floral resources and (iv) nesting sites for bumblebees, by comparing bioenergy crops with conventional arable and grass crops in a large network of commercial fields. We found that although there were more bumblebees in oilseed rape fields, conventional crops and bioenergy crops did not differ greatly in species richness of most pollinator groups, although more floral resources were found in the bioenergy crops. However, solitary bees were more abundant and species rich in energy crops than conventional wheat, and more trap-nesting bees and wasps were found in Miscanthus than oilseed rape. In addition, novel assemblages of solitary bees were found in the bioenergy crops. All pollinator groups, and flowering plants, were more abundant in field margins than in the centre of crop fields. Although there were no differences among crop types, nest-searching bumblebees were confined to field margins. This highlights the importance of field margins as forage and nesting habitat for pollinators in farmland. Synthesis and applications. Differential responses to field-scale growth of bioenergy crops were displayed by the taxonomic groups studied, suggesting that effects on biodiversity cannot be generalized from studies based on a small suite of taxonomic groups and must include a range of taxa for overarching results. To optimize habitat for pollinators in agricultural areas, our data suggest that a diversity of crop types at small scales may have positive impacts and supports appropriate management and conservation of field margins and hedgerows during conversion to bioenergy production.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, bees have an important role in ecosystem function and the provision of ecosystem services through their role as pollinators. The diversity of bee species in rural landscapes is influenced by the type of landscape features present, and by land-use and management practices. A key challenge is to understand and predict how species vary across the landscape; and the role of functional traits in determining compositional patterns. We systematically sampled wild bees in four types of landscape feature – open farmland, scattered farmland trees, roadside vegetation and streamside vegetation – in rural landscapes in southern Australia. Landscapes were selected to represent wooded or non-wooded combinations of these site types (e.g. roadside vegetation with or without trees), embedded in farmland with different land-uses (e.g. cropping, grazing). The species richness and abundance of bees was greater at sites containing little or no tree cover; and the cumulative richness of species was greater for tree-less sites than for those with trees. In contrast, species evenness was greatest in wooded site types, indicating these were less dominated by abundant generalist species. Open farmland and treeless roadsides had greater functional diversity (based on species traits) than wooded site types. Strong species trait associations were more numerous with open parts of the landscape, reflecting the greater functional diversity of open site types. These results suggest that a suite of the extant bee fauna can exploit large-scale transformation from former extensively wooded ecosystems to open agricultural landscapes. However, not all species are able to exploit modified landscapes and may disappear with further loss of wooded vegetation. Trait-based approaches provide insight into how changes in landscape pattern affect the bee fauna. Failure to adequately cater for multiple functional groups of bees across all landscape features could mean a substantial loss in species that rely on more natural cover, thus affecting ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Most crops grown in Europe, including sunflower (Helianthus annulus L.), benefit from insect pollination. However, valuing this benefit is not straightforward since estimates of the increase in sunflower yield vary from 18% to 100%. Most estimates have, moreover, been performed at plant scale, a scale that is not relevant for farmers who calculate at the field scale. In this four-year study, we quantified the contribution of insect pollination to sunflower yield at field and plant scales in working farm fields distributed along a gradient of pollinator diversity and abundance. Pollinators were found to increase field yield up to 40% (i.e. 0.7t/ha) and by 31.3% at plant scale; the magnitude of effect on yield being therefore similar at both scales. The pollinators increased the yield by increasing the number of fertilized seeds per plant with no significant effect on the unit mass of the seeds although there was a trade-off between number of seeds and unit mass. Among pollinators, honeybees were the main taxon impacting sunflower yield. Sunflower plant density was a strong determinant of yield, with higher numbers attracting increased numbers of honeybees. Using pollinator and wind exclusion, we finally quantified the relative contributions of self-pollination (~40%), insect pollination (~35%) and wind pollination (~20%). Our results show, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of the key role of pollinators in sunflower production at field scale in real farming conditions, and underscore the need to maintain suitable conditions for pollinators in agricultural landscapes.},

  abstract = {Oilseed rape (OSR, Brassica napus L.) is a common crop found in many European agricultural landscapes. It is pollinated by a wide variety of insects, but the reported contribution of pollinators to yield varies widely between studies (from 0 to 50%). Moreover, such a contribution has seldom been estimated at the field scale in real farming conditions. We analysed OSR yields in response to insect pollination; over four years, at two different scales: farm fields and individual plants. We used both empirical and experimental approaches along a gradient of pollinator diversity and abundance. The empirical approach was based on farm surveys (151 fields) while the experimental approach used various pollination exclusion methods (570 plants in 101 fields) to estimate the relative contributions of insect, wind, and self-pollination. The OSR yields were positively correlated to total bee abundance and bee genera diversity, through improved fruiting success and plant seed mass (after adjusting for plant biomass). Hoverfly diversity and abundance, and bumblebee abundance did not have any effect. The main OSR pollinators in our study were honeybees (Apis mellifera) and wild bees (Lasioglossum spp.). Yields were increased, on average, by up to 37.5% (27.7% – 47.5%) at field scale when bee genera diversity increased from a single genus to more than 10 genera (pan-trap data). Insect pollination contributed about 30% of plant yield. Self-pollination and wind pollination accounted for the remaining 70%, with self-pollination being the major contributor. Our study demonstrates that pollinator diversity and abundance, at least at very high levels, have a major effect on OSR yields. This suggests that establishing a monetary value for pollination services in OSR farming systems could be used to balance the cost of managing semi-natural habitats or meadows to maintain bees and other pollinators.},

2 We report pollen removal and deposition data by Apis mellifera and Bombus spp. during single visits to four cultivars of apples (Golden Delicious, Starkrimson Delicious, Empire/MacIntosh and Rome) and Mission almond. 
3 Apis and Bombus removed similar amounts of pollen from apple flowers but Bombus deposited more pollen on stigmas. Pollen-collecting bees removed more pollen from apple anthers than nectar-collecting bees. Apis that approached nectaries laterally deposited substantially less pollen than other visitors. 
4 Apis and Bombus removed and deposited similar amounts of pollen on almond flowers. Apis tended to remove more during pollen-collecting visits than nectar-collecting visits. The type of resource sought did not significantly influence deposition. 
5 Based on removal and deposition data, additions of Bombus may increase pollen delivery in apple orchards but reduce pollen delivery in almond orchards if Apis already serve as primary pollinators. Additional data on inter-tree and inter-row flights would be necessary to know how much these changes in pollen transfer might affect fertilization. 
6 Measures of pollen-transfer effectiveness do not provide a complete assessment of pollination value, but can serve as a general, inexpensive tool for pre-screening possible alternative pollinators.},

  abstract = {Agricultural intensification and landscape simplification have reduced flowering plant abundance and diversity worldwide, with subsequent negative effects on pollinators. To mitigate these effects, research and conservation have focused on incorporating flowering plants into agricultural landscapes through on-farm natural areas or flowering crops. However, while cover crops provide numerous agroecosystem services, they have received little attention for their role in providing floral resources for pollinators. In this study, we examined the value of cover crops for providing supplemental summer floral resources for both managed and wild bees in the Northern Great Plains of the United States, where a large proportion of honey bee colonies spend the summer. Specifically, using an experimental randomized plot design, we compared floral resources and bee visitation rates across 1, 2, 3, and 6-species cover crop mixes as well a 6-species annual native wildflower mix. We found that cover crop treatments including buckwheat provided the highest summer-long floral cover, higher than the annual native wildflower mix in which only two of six species bloomed, and that total bee visitation rates increased with higher floral cover. However, different bees were attracted to different treatments; honey bees and bumble bees were most attracted to mixes containing phacelia, while large-bodied solitary bees were more attracted to mixes including cultivated sunflower and to the wildflower mix, illustrating that the optimal plantings for attracting social or managed bees may differ from those attracting solitary wild bees. Additionally, while similar numbers of bee species visited the three main plants in our treatments (buckwheat, phacelia, and cultivated sunflower) more rare species visited cultivated sunflower while more common bees visited buckwheat and phacelia. Our results highlight the value of annual cover crops for providing pollinator resources in agricultural landscapes, particularly on rotated land where perennial flower plantings are less feasible, but illustrate trade-offs between attracting a large number of common generalist or managed bees versus attracting fewer individuals but species of potential conservation concern.},

I argue that ecology has numerous laws in this sense of the word, in the form of widespread, repeatable patterns in nature, but hardly any laws that are universally true. Typically, in other words, ecological patterns and the laws, rules and mechanisms that underpin them are contingent on the organisms involved, and their environment. This contingency is manageable at a relatively simple level of ecological organisation (for example the population dynamics of single and small numbers of species), and re-emerges also in a manageable form in large sets of species, over large spatial scales, or over long time periods, in the form of detail-free statistical patterns - recently called 'macroecology'. The contingency becomes overwhelmingly complicated at intermediate scales, characteristic of community ecology, where there are a large number of case histories, and very little other than weak, fuzzy generalisations. These arguments are illustrated by focusing on examples of typical studies in community ecology, and by way of contrast, on the macroecological relationship that emerges between local species richness and the size of the regional pool of species. The emergent pattern illustrated by local vs regional richness plots is extremely simple, despite the vast number of contingent processes and interactions involved in its generation. To discover general patterns, laws and rules in nature, ecology may need to pay less attention to the 'middle ground' of community ecology, relying less on reductionism and experimental manipulation, but increasing research efforts into macroecology.},

To effectively manage or promote biodiversity in heterogeneous environments such as intensive agrosystems, a thorough knowledge of the spatial and temporal scale of ecological factor effects is required. This study investigates the effects of ecological correlates on local wild bee diversity in semi-natural farmland habitats, and predicts changes in species richness according to local-scale and landscape-scale correlates to further guide bee conservation practices. Local floral richness, the proportion of semi-natural habitats in the landscape (1000m radius) and the type of semi-natural habitats influenced bee richness at a field scale. However, the magnitude of the effect varied seasonally and according to local bee abundance. Model predictions showed that increasing floral richness on farms had a greater effect on bee richness than increasing the proportion of semi-natural habitats. While increasing the number of semi-natural habitats would be a more effective strategy for promoting bee diversity at the landscape scale, it may not be feasible in intensive farming systems.},

The individual map products include existing global land cover maps such as GlobCover 2005 and MODIS v.5, regional maps such as AFRICOVER and national maps from mapping agencies and other organizations. The different products are ranked at the national level using crowdsourced data from Geo-Wiki to create a map that reflects the likelihood of cropland. Calibration with national and subnational crop statistics was then undertaken to distribute the cropland within each country and subnational unit. The new IIASA-IFPRI cropland product has been validated using very high-resolution satellite imagery via Geo-Wiki and has an overall accuracy of 82.4\%. It has also been compared with the EarthStat cropland product and shows a lower root mean square error on an independent data set collected from Geo-Wiki. The first ever global field size map was produced at the same resolution as the IIASA-IFPRI cropland map based on interpolation of field size data collected via a Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing campaign. A validation exercise of the global field size map revealed satisfactory agreement with control data, particularly given the relatively modest size of the field size data set used to create the map. Both are critical inputs to global agricultural monitoring in the frame of GEOGLAM and will serve the global land modelling and integrated assessment community, in particular for improving land use models that require baseline cropland information.

We performed a meta-analysis of studies testing for effects of herbivores on floral traits, plant attractiveness to pollinators, and plant reproductive success. We also assessed whether herbivore effects depended on the plant tissue attacked by herbivores and if real or simulated herbivory was used. We found an overall significant negative effect of herbivores on floral traits, plant attractiveness to pollinators, and plant reproductive success. These effects were, however, contingent on the plant tissue attacked and on whether real or simulated damage was used. Real floral and leaf, but not root, herbivores showed detrimental effects on floral traits and plant attractiveness to pollinators. In addition, real leaf, but not floral or root herbivory, lowered plant reproductive success. Contrastingly, simulated leaf and floral herbivory showed no effect on any of the response variables. These findings help move forward our understanding of the strength and directionality of herbivore effects on plant attractiveness to pollinators and their underlying mechanisms.},

The model provides a reasonable fit to the observed data, and the two species do not differ significantly with regard to the parameter estimates. Inflorescence number and capsule number have large significant effects on fitness, but the effect of number of seeds per capsule is not significant. Leaf areas during midlife influence fitness indirectly via production of reproduction structures; during late—life they have a direct effect on fitness via seed filling. The analysis of fitness components using the method of structural equation model fills an intermediary role between simple morphometric analysis and more explicit modelling of physiological processes.},

We apply the four postulates to an important class of pulse events, biomass-altering disturbances, and derive seven generalizations that predict disturbance magnitude, resource trajectory, rate of resource change, disturbance probability, biotic trait diversification at evolutionary scales, biotic diversity at ecological scales, and functional resilience. Ultimately, theory must define the variable combinations that result in dynamic stability, comprising resistance, recovery, and adaptation.},

  abstract = {Insect pollination is a well-studied ecosystem service that supports production in 75% of globally important crops. Although yield is known to be sustained and regulated by a bundle of ecosystem services and management factors, the contribution of pollination to yield has been mostly studied in isolation. Here, we compiled and reviewed research on the contribution of pollination to crop yield under different environmental conditions, where the potential interaction between pollination and other factors contributing to yield, such as nutrient availability and control of pests, was tested. Specifically, we explored whether pollination displayed synergistic, compensatory or additive effects with concomitant factors. The literature search resulted in 24 peer-reviewed studies for a total of 39 individual tests of interactions. Studies examined responses in 13 crops testing interactions both at the local and the landscape scale. Interactions between pollination and other factors influencing yield were observed for several crops and mostly displayed positive-synergistic relationships. Crop life-history traits such as pollination dependency were found to affect the plant response to variations in resource and pollen availability. Soil properties and crop pests might affect contribution of pollination to yield by altering the amount of resources a plant can allocate to reproduction, independently of the amount of pollen provided. Current management strategies to enhance pollinators might fail to increase pollination benefits in landscapes characterized by poor soil resources or ineffective pest control. We propose that our understanding of the effects of crop-pollinator interactions will benefit by focusing on plant traits and physiological responses. Combining knowledge from plant physiology and ecology with technological advances in agriculture is needed to design novel management strategies to maximize pollination benefits and support yields and reduce environmental impacts of food production.},

  abstract  = {The continuing pollinator crisis is due, in part, to the lack of year-round floral resources. In intensive farming regions, such as the Upper Midwest (UMW) of the USA, natural and pastoral vegetation largely has been replaced by annual crops such as maize (Zea mays L.), soyabean (Glycine max L.) and wheat (Triticum spp.). Neither the energy (nectar) nor protein (pollen) needs of pollinating and other beneficial insects are being met sufficiently by the new, high-intensity, agricultural landscape. Several potentially useful oilseed crops can be grown in the UMW, and many of these oilseeds are highly attractive to beneficial insects. Prior research showed that some of these oilseeds produced abundant nectar, but their corresponding values for pollen production are unknown. Accordingly, the aim of our research was to document pollen (and protein) production per unit area of twelve oilseed crops grown in Minnesota and associate these values with levels of beneficial insect visitation during anthesis. Our results show that oilseed crops such as camelina (Camelina sativa L.), flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) and pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) produce relatively little pollen (=<40 kg/ha); borage (Borago officinalis L.), calendula (Calendula officinalis L.), canola (Brassica napus L.), crambe (Crambe abyssianica Hochst) and cuphea (Cuphea viscosissima Jacq. × Cuphea lanceolata W. T. Aiton) produce bountiful pollen resources (50–150 kg/ha); and oilseed echium (Echium plantagineum L.) generates massive amounts of pollen (>400 kg/ha), about 50% of which is protein. Our study is unique in presenting a season-long perspective of pollen production in alternative oilseed crops, a resource valuable to pollen-feeding insects such as managed and wild bees. Diversification of UMW landscapes that includes alternative oilseed crops such as oilseed echium and cuphea can potentially provide a ready source of pollen and protein to help combat pollinator decline},

To examine these hypotheses, I observed the visitation of bumble bees (genus Bombus) across experimental manipulations of plant density in patches of bergamot(Monarda fistulosa) in southwest Alberta, Canada over 2 summers. Bees flew more often and for a greater proportion of time, and hit their wings more frequently, in low-density patches. In 2004, bees ``undermatched” resources (relatively few bees in high density patches). In 2005, bees achieved an ideal free distribution. Overall, wing wear and energy costs alone cannot explain bumble bee use of their floral resources (in either year), while the ideal free distribution sometimes can(i.e., in 2005). This study therefore complements the findings of ideal free distributions in other aspects of the foraging ecology of pollinators.},

  abstract  = {This study considers how a forager moves through its environment when food is patchily distributed and the patches differ in quality. One possibility is to move directionally among patches, staying longer in the best patches (the “Local-Experience Hypothesis”). Additionally, when foragers reuse patches in a regenerating environment, they can potentially benefit from remembering the most profitable patches, and return preferentially to these (the “Memory Hypothesis”). Both hypotheses were tested with foraging bumble bees (Bombus spp.) collecting nectar in the foothills and mountains of southwest Alberta, Canada. Individually marked worker bumble bees were observed visiting flowers on focal plants of five species visited primarily by bumble bees. In three plant species (Epilobium angustifolium, Hedysarum alpinum, and Penstemon confertus), variation in nectar secretion rate was experimentally induced by defoliation and fertilization of individual plants. In the other two species (H. sulphurescens and Oxytropis monticola), bees' responses to natural variation in plant-level nectar secretion were measured. Considering the bee population as a whole, plants with higher nectar production rates attracted more bees (three of five plant species) and had more of their flowers visited (three of five plant species). The Local-Experience Hypothesis was supported in three of the five plant species: individual bees stayed longer by visiting more flowers on plants with higher rates of nectar production. The Memory Hypothesis was supported in four of the five plant species; individual bees were more likely to return to plants with higher rates of nectar secretion. Overall, there was a positive correlation between the extent to which individual plants differed in their rate of nectar secretion (a species-level trait), and the strength of support for the Memory Hypothesis (measured as a standardized effect size). That is, individual bumble bees more strongly adjusted their visitation rate based on plant quality as the magnitude of natural differences in plant quality increased. Support for the Memory Hypothesis may explain why bumble bees often revisit the same plants on successive foraging trips: memory for good plants gives them a fitness advantage over naïve bees using the same area. Bumble bees appear to use a relatively sophisticated spatial memory in resource tracking, which may constrain the evolution of empty-flower strategies of plant nectar secretion.},

  abstract  = {In Europe, oilseed rape is the principal crop used in the production of edible and renewable fuel oil products. Insect pollinators, in particular bees, have been shown to have a positive effect on the seed set of this crop. We undertook experiments looking at behavioural differences between honeybees, bumblebees and solitary bees visiting oilseed rape flowers, and related this to landscape scale responses in visitation rates. We found that behavioural differences between honeybees, bumblebees and solitary bees alter the likelihood of pollen transfer from their bodies to the plant stigma. Solitary bees and bumblebees tend to have greater rates of stigmal contact than honeybees. The interactions between the likelihood of free pollen on bodies and the probability of stigmal contact suggest that only 34.0% of visitations by honeybees were likely to result in pollen transfer to the stigma, relative to 35.1% for the bumblebees and 71.3% for solitary bees. Visitation rates were higher for honeybees in high quality landscapes with relatively large areas of alternative foraging habitat. Visitation rates of honeybees were also more frequent in the vicinity of managed hives. For solitary bees and bumblebees visitation rates did not respond to landscape structure, although more species of solitary bees were found in landscapes with a high cover of semi-natural grassland. While honeybees may be less efficient in pollen transfer per unit visit, where they numerically outweigh other types of bees in a crop (e.g. around managed hives) this may not be important. For this reason the relative ease with which hives can be moved across landscape means that honeybees are perhaps the most suitable taxa for use as a pro-active mitigation measure against pollinator deficits. However, the greater efficiency of solitary bees compensates for the effort required to implement longer term management (i.e. the establishment of flower rich field margins and open soil nesting sites) to support their populations.},

  abstract = {Sustainable and resilient agricultural systems are needed to feed and fuel a growing human population. However, the current model of agricultural intensification which produces high yields has also resulted in a loss of biodiversity, ecological function, and critical ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. A key consequence of agricultural intensification is landscape simplification, where once heterogeneous landscapes contain increasingly fewer crop and non-crop habitats. Landscape simplification exacerbates biodiversity losses which leads to reductions in ecosystem services on which agriculture depends. In recent decades, considerable research has focused on mitigating these negative impacts, primarily via management of habitats to promote biodiversity and enhance services at the local scale. While it is well known that local and landscape factors interact, modifying overall landscape structure is seldom considered due to logistical constraints. I propose that the loss of ecosystem services due to landscape simplification can only be addressed by a concerted effort to fundamentally redesign agricultural landscapes. Designing agricultural landscapes will require that scientists work with stakeholders to determine the mix of desired ecosystem services, evaluate current landscape structure in light of those goals, and implement targeted modifications to achieve them. I evaluate the current status of landscape design, ranging from fundamental ecological principles to resulting guidelines and socioeconomic tools. While research gaps remain, the time is right for ecologists to engage with other disciplines, stakeholders, and policymakers in education and advocacy to foster agricultural landscape design for sustainable and resilient biodiversity services.},

  abstract  = {Annual crop fields typically are simple habitats dominated by a few plant species where pesticides play a major role in managing weed and insect infestations. Recently, there has been significant interest in the potential to reduce reliance on pesticides by manipulating plant species and communities to benefit natural enemies of insects and weeds. Such efforts aim to enhance natural enemy impact by providing appropriate food, shelter, and hosts, and efforts typically are accomplished by manipulation of plant species, populations, or communities. Habitat management is generally viewed as an important factor in maintaining stable insect and natural enemy populations in agricultural systems and may have a similar function in increasing weed seed predation. Crop and noncrop habitats provide resources to natural enemies either directly through floral nectar and pollen, indirectly by increased host or prey availability, or through emergent properties of the habitat such as by moderating the microclimate. These critical resources for natural enemies can be provided in agricultural ecosystems at several scales: within fields, at field margins, or as a component of the larger landscape. Because individual natural enemy species may require quite specific resources at different times and spatial scales, not all attempts to manipulate habitat diversity are equally effective. We review the role of plant resources, including weeds, in supporting natural enemy communities and provide case studies of how varying plant diversity at different spatial scales can influence the effectiveness of biological control in agricultural landscapes.},

The method removed free amino acids that leach from pollen and confound chromatography, but without autohydrolyzing sucrose. Pollen sugars were a negligible fraction of provision mass sugars. Glucose and fructose constituted about half of the provision fresh weight. Sucrose in alfalfa pollen and nectar is absent from the provision, presumably enzymatically hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose in the provision. Provision masses are composed of two to three times more floral equivalents in pollen than nectar. Female M. rotundata, and other solitary bees with pasty provisions, gather proportionally more pollen than nectar compared with the resource needs of colonies of social honeybees and bumblebees.},

  abstract  = {Aim: Leafcutter bees use plants as pollen and nectar sources, but also cut leaf discs and use them to line their nests. Which plant species they choose as nesting material and why they do so have remained obscure. We asked the following: (1) How are the plant  species  used  by  leafcutter  bees  distributed  phylogenetically?  (2)  Does  plant  choice differ across geographical regions, and if so, in what ways? (3) Are the leaf plant species natives or exotics? (4) What plant and leaf traits predict selection of plant spe-cies by leafcutter bees? And (5) Does the abundance of individuals per species in the habitat influence leafcutter bees’ plant preferences?
Location: Tropical South Asia, temperate eastern Canada and US Sonoran Desert
Methods: We mapped taxa known to be used by leafcutter bees both from our own study and published literature onto the most recent angiosperm phylogeny. To deter-mine what plant and leaf traits predict leaf selection, we monitored 6,120 individuals of 214 native and exotic plant species planted in a 3- sq. km. arboretum in Arizona and recorded leaf damage inflicted by bees.
Results: Megachile showed a strong preference for species in the rosid clade, particularly the phylogenetic cluster of Fabales, Fagales and Rosales. Thirty- two to forty- five percentage of the leaf plant species were exotic to a given region. Membership in the rosid clade and Fabaceae family predicted plant preference, whereas the plant species’ local abundance and geographical origin did not. Leaf water content, morphotype and the  presence  of  latex  were  important  factors  influencing  plant  choice,  whereas  leaf  shape and size did not.
Main  conclusion:  These  patterns  point  to  plant  groups  whose  availability  should  be  monitored to assure persistence of leafcutter bees. Their preference for specific globally distributed plant clades, yet ability to readily adopt certain exotic plant species as nest resources, likely augments their ability to persist.},

For every cohort of flowers an array of yield measures was calculated, including the mean and total cohort dry weight of fruits, and the numbers of viable and aborted seeds and completely undeveloped ovules. When mature, pods were removed from half of the plants. Plants whose mature pods were removed produced significantly greater numbers of flowers, ovules and viable seeds and a greater total weight of pods than did untreated plants. However, the proportion of ovules giving rise to viable seeds and to aborted seeds and undeveloped ovules was the same in plants of both groups. Approximately 50% of ovules of marketable pods, in all plants, yielded viable seeds. The 12 cohorts of flowers contributed markedly different amounts to plant yield. Early and later cohorts contributed much less than did middle cohorts in terms of marketable pod dry weight and numbers of fully developed seeds, aborted seeds, and undeveloped ovules. Peak productivity was therefore obtained from the middle phase of flowering in these annual bean plants. The lower pod yield of later cohorts is interpreted as a result of competition for limited resources between maturing pods and new flowers. We consider possible causes for the various fates of flowers and ovules and discuss flowers as plant modules suitable for demographic examination.},

The relationship between vegetative and reproductive growth was examined after two-thirds of the flowers were removed from half the experimental plants. This resulted in larger plants which had fewer, larger fruits and eventually a fruit yield almost as large as the controls.

In the control plants, fruit growth increased steadily until it reached 90% of the total incremental fresh weight of the plant 50–60 days after first anthesis. Leaf growth was markedly depressed at this stage and root growth ceased 4 wk after anthesis. Some root death was observed from anthesis onwards. When fruit growth subsequently diminished, vegetative growth recovered but to a lower rate than before fruiting commenced. Following partial flower removal, only 64% or less of the total increment of fresh weight went into the fruit. Although vegetative growth at this stage was thus greater than in the control plants, both shoot and root growth followed the same qualitative pattern with time.

The ratio of vegetative shoot to root fresh weight remained essentially constant throughout the fruiting phase in plants of both sowings whether flowers were removed or not. This suggests that the fruit grew in competition with the vegetative organs as a whole, although, for a short period at early fruiting, root growth was more seriously affected.

The pattern and amount of fruiting in this indeterminate plant was influenced by the size of the vegetative organs at fruiting, and by the effect of the existing developing fruit on further vegetative and reproductive growth.},

  abstract  = {1. There is increasing recognition that pollination deficits are limiting crop yields world-wide. However, management strategies for optimal insect pollination are still unclear for most crops. Current management focuses on providing high densities of honeybees, but recommended densities are highly variable, even within single crops and cultivars.
2. We performed an extensive literature search to record honeybee densities (colony density and/or flower visitation rates) and crop productivity (fruit set, seed set, fruit weight and/or yield). Effect sizes were represented as the difference in crop productivity between the two most extreme levels of honeybee densities.
3. Out of 795 reviewed studies, only 22 analysed the effect of at least two levels of honeybee densities on crop productivity (reporting 60 resulting effect sizes in total). Moreover, few recommendations for crop pollination management are based on results from controlled experimental designs, and with comparable methodology.
4. We found that both colony density and visitation rates increased all the productivity variables. However, effects were nonlinear for visitation rates, suggesting that there is an optimum (mean of 8–10 visits per flower) beyond which more honeybees are not beneficial (and can even be detrimental) for crop productivity.
5. Effect sizes for visitation rates were greater than that for colony densities, suggesting that visitation rates are a more direct measure of the pollination process. Data on the relation between colony density and visitation rates are lacking. Interestingly, effect sizes for visitation rates were greater for crops with separate sexes than those with hermaphroditic flowers; therefore, the benefits of honeybee pollination vary according to the crop biology.
6. Synthesis and applications. Current practices for crop pollination assume that more honeybees are always better for crop yield, even if the effect of this management on crop production still unclear. In contrast, our analyses suggest that there is an optimum for honeybee densities. Despite the importance of honeybees and pollinator-dependent crops world-wide, there is a lack of studies designed for finding such an optimal level of crop pollination. Our analyses further suggest that visitation rates could be used as a proxy to guide management recommendations such as colony density and spatial arrangement.},

  abstract  = {1. Ecological intensification has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate the impacts of conventional intensive land use on pollinators and insect pollination. However, research has concentrated on the effects of land management on pollinator abundance and diversity, while studies directly measuring pollination services are still lacking for many crops and regions.
2. This study examines the effects of landscape heterogeneity, pesticide use intensity and flowering time on insect pollination of turnip rape Brassica rapa ssp. oleifera, a major oil crop at high latitudes. The field experiment included monitoring pollinator visits on turnip rape flowers and measuring yield in 34 spring-sown turnip rape fields in Southern Finland. The fields were situated in two landscape types that differed in the cover of arable land and represented independent gradients of pesticide use intensity and flowering time.
3. Based on flower visits and number of seeds per silique, turnip rape was best pollinated in fields with late flowering time. The result suggests a temporal mismatch between crop flowering and the availability of pollination service in early sown fields. The increase in flower visits during summer was steeper among fields with low than high pesticide use, possibly due to a faster colony growth of important bee pollinators.
4. Pollinator community in turnip rape fields was more diverse in heterogeneous landscapes with less arable land than in homogeneous field-dominated landscapes, suggesting higher stability of pollination services in diverse landscapes.
5. Total yield per plant was positively related to pesticide use intensity. The relationship between insect pollination and total yield was weakened by high compensation capacity of turnip rape, the plants producing more flowers under poor pollination.
6. Synthesis and applications. Crop pollination can be enhanced by shifting sowing time to better match crop flowering to the peak availability of the most important pollinators. Reduced pesticide use may also enhance pollination services but can lead to the total yield reduction due to pests. This highlights the need for pollinator-friendly pest control methods to maintain turnip rape yields while conserving pollination services.},

  abstract  = {The honeybee dance language, in which foragers perform dances containing information about the distance and direction to food sources, is the quintessential example of symbolic communication in non-primates1,2. The dance language has been the subject of controversy3,4, and of extensive research into the mechanisms of acquiring1,5,6, decoding7,8 and evaluating9 the information in the dance. The dance language has been hypothesized, but not shown, to increase colony food collection1,9,10. Here we show that colonies with disoriented dances (lacking direction information) recruit less effectively to syrup feeders than do colonies with oriented dances. For colonies foraging at natural sources, the direction information sometimes increases food collected, but at other times it makes no difference. The food-location information in the dance is presumably important when food sources are hard to find, variable in richness and ephemeral. Recruitment based simply on arousal of foragers and communication of floral odour, as occurs in honeybees1, bumble bees11 and some stingless bees12, can be equally effective under other circumstances. Clarifying the condition-dependent payoffs of the dance language provides new insight into its function in honeybee ecology.},

Community ecology can provide behavioral ecology with the tools to ask realistic questions about the current action of natural selection. Evolutionary ecology has moved beyond asking “Why does trait x contribute to reproductive success?” and on to “What are the conditions under which trait x contributes to reproductive success?” We need to bring this ecological perspective to the study of the evolution of behavior. Community ecologists have recognized that behavior influences ecological outcomes. For example, behavior contributes to the effect of history on community assembly, to indirect effects in predator–prey interactions, and to the responses of populations to human disturbance. More generally, behavior is often the source of context dependence; behavioral responses in different conditions lead to different ecological outcomes. As community ecology is broadening to include behavior, behavioral ecologists can begin to incorporate ecological perspectives in asking evolutionary questions.},

  abstract  = {Seed-eating ants are part of a guild of granivorous desert species that compete for food. This study examines the factors that influence the intensity, location, or temporal pattern of foraging in the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus. I consider behavioral flexibility on three time scales: year to year, day to day, and hour to hour. On a yearly time scale, there does not appear to be any simple relation between high intensities of foraging and survival rate. Colony-specific differences in foraging activity persist from one year to the next, but survivorship is not higher in colonies more likely to forage. Distributions of nests change from one year to the next and are usually underdispersed or clumped. Colonies live for 15-20 yr. Colony behavior is more stable, and more likely to avoid intraspecific conflict, in older colonies (>5 yr old) than in younger ones (2 yr old). Mortality rates of 2-yr-old colonies are similar to those of older ones. Other results suggest that a colony's competitive status is determined by its behavioral flexibility in changing conditions, on daily and hourly time scales. Each day that a colony forages, it chooses a few foraging routes out of a larger set of available ones. This decision is made early each day by the patrollers, a distinct group of workers, before the foragers emerge from the nest. The choice of foraging trails is influenced by interactions with neighboring colonies. The extent to which neighboring colonies forage on trails that intersect, and engage in long-term conflict, depends on colony age and food availability. When there is a food incentive, pairs of neighboring younger colonies are more likely than older pairs to continue using foraging trails that overlap. On an hourly time scale, the intensity of foraging depends on the rate of food intake and on the activities of workers, such as patrollers, engaged in other tasks besides foraging.},

  abstract = {A honey bee colony can skillfully choose among nectar sources. It will selectively exploit the most profitable source in an array and will rapidly shift its foraging efforts following changes in the array. How does this colony-level ability emerge from the behavior of individual bees? The answer lies in understanding how bees modulate their colony's rates of recruitment and abandonment for nectar sources in accordance with the profitability of each source. A forager modulates its behavior in relation to nectar source profitability: as profitability increases, the tempo of foraging increases, the intensity of dancing increases, and the probability of abandoning the source decreases. How does a forager assess the profitability of its nectar source? Bees accomplish this without making comparisons among nectar sources. Neither do the foragers compare different nectar sources to determine the relative profitability of any one source, nor do the food storers compare different nectar loads and indicate the relative profitability of each load to the foragers. Instead, each forager knows only about its particular nectar source and independently calculates the absolute profitability of its source. Even though each of a colony's foragers operates with extremely limited information about the colony's food sources, together they will generate a coherent colonylevel response to different food sources in which better ones are heavily exploited and poorer ones are abandoned. This is shown by a computer simulation of nectar-source selection by a colony in which foragers behave as described above. Nectar-source selection by honey bee colonies is a process of natural selection among alternative nectar sources as foragers from more profitable sources ``survive'' (continue visiting their source) longer and ``reproduce'' (recruit other foragers) better than do foragers from less profitable sources. Hence this colonial decision-making is based on decentralized control. We suggest that honey bee colonies possess decentralized decision-making because it combines effectiveness with simplicity of communication and computation within a colony.},

These types of interactions may select for increased learning and memory capabilities in highly social species. The advanced learning capabilities associated with social life may also promote an increased capacity for learning other specific tasks, such as foraging. Therefore, social bees may show a higher capacity for learning and remembering floral characteristics relative to this same capacity in solitary bees. To test this prediction, the performance of a social species of bumblebee, Bombus bimaculatus (Apidae), and a solitary species of carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica (Anthophoridae) was compared in three experiments in which bees had to learn to discriminate between rewarding and non-rewarding flowers that differed in colour. In all three experiments bumblebees showed higher learning rates compared with carpenter bees. However, both species showed similar levels of overnight memory retention. The results suggest that social bees have better learning capabilities compared with solitary bees.},

  abstract  = {Animals foraging in nature must often balance simultaneously feeding and anti-predator demands. Predation hazard usually reduces foraging efficiency because foragers may remain sheltered rather than feed, choose less profitable but safer foraging sites, or watch for predators instead of searching for food (Milinski and Heller 1978; Sih 1980, 1992; Werner et al. 1983; Lawrence 1985; Gilliam 1990; Lima and Dill 1990). Social organization can significantly enhance foraging efficiency under preda- tion hazard because group foragers can often reduce vigilance and increase feed- ing time compared with solitary foragers (Caraco 1979; Pulliam and Caraco 1984; Cassini 1991; Burger and Gochfeld 1992). Unlike some birds and mammals, the workers of most social bees and wasps do not forage in groups and are thus not able to gain this advantage. But the fact that the workers of social hymenopterans deliver their food recoveries to the colony and do not participate directly in reproduction suggests another possible advantage of sociality. Our study was stimulated by field observations suggesting more vigilant behav- ior by solitary than by social bees. A simple explanation for this difference in behavior might be that the death of a social bee forager has minimal effect on overall colony fitness (eusociality results in the decoupling of provisioning and parental care), whereas the death of a solitary bee terminates her fitness entirely. We now believe this explanation to be incorrect: the death of a social bee forager reduces colony reproduction through the loss of her future food recoveries; how- ever, all her past recoveries do add to colony fitness. In contrast, the current day's recoveries of a solitary bee are lost if she is killed before an egg is deposited and the egg-food cell is sealed (Michener 1974; Batra 1984). This difference may account for the observed differences in behavior between social and solitary bees. We constructed models of social and solitary bee foraging behavior under risk of predation, in order to examine this idea},

In different experimental combinations of reward rates, color marks, odors and distances of the feeders, the behavior of the test bee was monitored by a computer in real time by several devices installed in each feeder. The test bee optimizes by partially matching its choice behavior to the reward rates of the feeders. The matching behavior differs strongly between “stay” flights (the bee chooses the feeder just visited) and “shift” flights (the bee chooses one of the three alternative feeders). The probability of stay and shift flights depends on the reward sequence and on the time interval between successive visits. Since functions describing the rising probability of stay flights with rising amounts of sucrose solution just experienced differ for the four feeders, it is concluded that bees develop feeder-specific memories. The choice profiles of shift flights between the three alternative feeders depend on the mean reward rate of the feeder last visited. Good matching is found after visits to the low-reward feeders and poor matching following departure from the high-reward feeders. These results indicate that bees use two different kinds of memories to guide their choice behavior: a transient short-term working memory that is not feeder-specific, and a feeder-specific long-term reference memory. Model calculations were carried out to test this hypothesis. The model was based on a learning rule (the difference rule) developed by Rescorla and Wagner (1972), which was extended to the two forms of memories to predict this operant behavior. The experiments show that a foraging honeybee learns the properties of a food source (its signals and rewards) so effectively that specific expectations guide the choice behavior.},

Nest entrances tend to be small, 10 to 40 cm2, and at the nest bottom. Rough bark outside the entrance is often smoothed by the bees. Inside the nest, a thin layer of hardened plant resins (propolis) coats the cavity walls. Combs are fastened to the walls along their tops and sides, but bees leave small passageways along the comb edges. The basic nest organization is honey storage above, brood nest below, and pollen storage in between. Associated with this arrangement are differences in comb structure. Compared to combs used for honey storage, combs of the brood nest are generally darker and more uniform in width and in cell form. Drone comb is located on the brood nest's periphery.

The need for food promotes maximisation of the intake rate, and the high costs call for energetic optimisation. Experiments on how honeybees resolve this conflict have to consider that foraging takes place in a variable environment concerning microclimate and food quality and availability. Here we report, in simultaneous measurements of energy costs, gains, and intake rate and efficiency, how honeybee foragers manage this challenge in their highly variable environment. If possible, during unlimited sucrose flow, they follow an ‘investment-guided’ (‘time is honey’) economic strategy promising increased returns. They maximise net intake rate by investing both own heat production and solar heat to increase body temperature to a level which guarantees a high suction velocity. They switch to an ‘economizing’ (‘save the honey’) optimisation of energetic efficiency if the intake rate is restricted by the food source when an increased body temperature would not guarantee a high intake rate. With this flexible and graded change between economic strategies honeybees can do both maximise colony intake rate and optimise foraging efficiency in reaction to environmental variation.},

The patterns of survivorship are likely to influence the evolution of foraging behavior, and this result suggests that age-independent factors such as predation could play a strong role in selection of foraging range and other parameters. Our result is contrary to the pattern expected if the survivorship of individual honey bee foragers is determined largely by a limited lifetime budget of energy expenditure, which would imply a low probability of mortality early in a bee's foraging life, followed by a sharp increase in mortality late in life, when either physiological or mechanical wear cause death.},

  abstract  = {Honeybees acquire wing damage as they age and older foraging honeybees accept lavender inflorescences with fewer flowers. These indicate the operation of some kind of optimal response, but this cannot be based on energy because energy expenditure does not change as the wings get damaged. However, wingbeat frequency increases with wing damage. A deterministic analytical model was constructed, based on the assumptions that bees have a limited total number of wingbeats that the flight motor can perform and that they maximize lifetime energy profit by conserving the number of wingbeats used in foraging. The optimal response to wing damage is to reduce the threshold number of flowers needed to accept an inflorescence. The predicted optimal gradient between wing damage (wingbeat frequency) and acceptance threshold (number of flowers on an inflorescence) was close to the observed gradient from field data. This model demonstrates that wear and tear is a significant factor in optimal foraging strategies},

Because of its preference for legumes, it has long been overlooked as a potential pollinator of other open field crops: It is presently unclear what crops the ALB might pollinate in cages. I compared the pollination efficiency of the ALB with that of the honey bee (HB) on hybrid carrots using a male sterile 'Imperator' line and a 'Nantes' male fertile line in field cages in Idaho. Three cages each contained a standard deep super of honey bees (c. 3000 adults with four frames of brood); three other cages received approximately 100 male and 50 female ALBs. The honey bees were also supplied with corn syrup, a protein patty and water. The ALB cages were furnished with non-blooming alfalfa plants for leaf cuttings, and ALB nest blocks. For the 'Imperator' line, there was no significant difference in seed production between HB or ALB treatments (2228 and 2158 mg seed/primary inflorescence; ANOV, P > 0.25), nor was there a difference in the percent seed germination between the pollination treatments (ANOV, P > 0.20). ALB brood reared on carrot pollen and nectar reached adult weights indistinguishable from that of brood reared on alfalfa. For the pollination of hybrid carrots, 30 female ALBs seem equivalent to 100 times as many worker honey bees.},

Pollen was collected from bees returning to a hive, to determine daily variation in pollen loads collected and to what level the bees were foraging for carrot pollen. Honey bees visited a wide range of alternative pollen sources and made relatively few visits to carrot plants throughout the period of flowering. Visitation rates to other individual floral sources fluctuated but visitation to carrot was consistently low. The underlying rate of carrot pollen visits among collecting trips was modelled and estimated to be as low as 1.4%, a likely cause of the limited success implementing honey bee hives in carrot crops.},

The bees moved to rows with different cultivars more frequently that to rows with the same cultivar. However, the direction of movement and cultivar preference did not differ significantly between the two species of bees.

Honeybees foraged in greater numbers, and on more flowers per bee than did leafcutter bees. The amount of movement also varied with the cultivars that were used. Few bees moved between the cultivars that differed greatly in appearance and growth habit (e.g. Aladin and 15025). The amount of movement between the cultivars Aladin and CM4 was much higher, ranging from 27 to 43 percent in honeybees and 22 percent in leafcutter bees. Honeybees were more effective than leafcutter bees as pollinators of faba beans in caged plots.},

(3) Insects which visited only a few florets on each inflorescence were found almost always to cause lower seed set than those which based their decision to leave on the reward status of the inflorescence, even though the rate of inter-inflorescence transitions was greater for the former behavioural specification. Since the second type of behaviour is characteristic of real bumble bees and always returns a higher profit to the insect, it is concluded that the co-evolutionary relationship between Bombus and red clover is adapted to maximize the self-interests of both partners.},

Preliminary results from studies of the responses of agro-ecosystems to subtle changes in stress indicate an exceptional opportunity for integrative research on agro-ecosystems. In the near future this research will be directed toward answering major questions about the long-term stability of agro-ecosystems and their effects on neighboring ecosystems in the agricultural landscape.},

Malnutrition persists among large sections of the population, and a new epidemic of obesity is on the rise. We review both the successes and failures of the global food system, addressing ongoing debates on pathways to environmental health and food security. To deal with these challenges, a new coordinated research program blending modern breeding with agro-ecological methods is needed.

As a mass-flowering crop grown intensively throughout the Canadian Prairies, canola has the potential to influence pollinator success across tens of thousands of square kilometers of cropland. Bumble bees (Bombus sp.) are efficient pollinators of many types of native and crop plants. We measured the influence of this mass-flowering crop on the abundance and phenology of bumble bees, and on another species of social bee (a sweat bee; Halictus rubicundus), by continuously deploying traps at different levels of canola cultivation intensity, spanning the start and end of canola bloom. Queen bumble bees were more abundant in areas with more canola cover, indicating that this crop is attractive to queens. However, bumble bee workers were significantly fewer in these locations later in the season, suggesting reduced colony success. The median collection dates of workers of three bumble bee species were earlier near canola fields, suggesting a dynamic response of colonies to the increased floral resources. Different species experienced this shift to different extents. The sweat bee was not affected by canola cultivation intensity. Our findings suggest that mass-flowering crops such as canola are attractive to bumble bee queens and therefore may lead to higher rates of colony establishment, but also that colonies established near this crop may be less successful. We propose that the effect on bumble bees can be mitigated by spacing the crop more evenly with respect to alternate floral resources},

Research on the impact of fauna activity on agricultural production focuses mostly on either the costs (e.g. crop damage) or benefits (e.g. pollination) of this activity, with few studies addressing cost--benefit trade-offs in the same context. This has resulted in an incomplete understanding of the implications of fauna activity in agroecosystems. Through a systematic review of the literature, we connect disparate studies to promote a more holistic approach to research on wild fauna in agriculture. We identified 281 studies that quantified a cost and/or benefit of fauna activity in crop systems. Overall, 53.0 {\%} of studies examined the costs of insect and/or bird activity, 37.7 {\%} of studies examined benefits and just 9.3 {\%} of studies covered both costs and benefits of insect and/or bird activity simultaneously. Most birds studied were omnivorous (44.8 {\%}), granivorous (29.0 {\%}) or insectivorous (16.6 {\%}), while insect studies focused on pollinators (42.2 {\%}) or borers (17.5 {\%}). There were clear geographic patterns for studies, with a bias towards studies of the costs of bird activity in North America and studies of benefits in Central America/Caribbean. Most studies on benefits occurred in perennial crops and most cost studies in annual crops. Our results highlight the disjointed nature of research into the cost--benefit trade-offs of fauna activity, and it is essential that future studies examine these trade-offs in order to develop sustainable agricultural strategies that limit production losses while maximising the delivery of ecosystem services from fauna.},

  abstract  = {At present, agroecology can be interpreted as a scientific discipline, as a movement or as a practice. In this paper we analyse the historical evolution of the scientific discipline of agroecology with a quantitative bibliometric analysis of 711 publications using the term agroecology and the derived term agroecological, as well as a qualitative analysis of definitions, topics and scales, where we also include further important works on agroecology. Agroecology emerged in the 1930s and the period up until the 1960s was the initial phase of agroecology. During the 1970s and 1980s, agroecology as a science expanded, and in the 1990s became institutionalized and consolidated. Since the 2000s, broader definitions have provided the basis for new dimensions in agroecology. During the last two decades the range of topics treated within agroecology grew enormously; also the publication rate has exploded within the last 10 years. The scale and dimension of scientific research in agroecology has changed over the past 80 years from the plot or field scale to the farm or agroecosystem scale and finally to the food system. Currently, three approaches persist: (1) the plot/field scale; (2) the agroecosystem/farm scale; and (3) the food system approach. In spite of a vague utilization of the term agroecology through its different meanings and definitions, the new views and dimensions brought to agroecology as a scientific discipline will probably facilitate efforts to respond to actual important questions on sustainable agriculture, global land use and climate change, or food security, due to increasingly applied systems thinking and interdisciplinary research approaches.},

This review outlines the key characteristics of globalization and then details the changes occurring to agriculture and the broader agrifood system. It addresses the worldwide spread of productivist, specialized, industrial-style farming methods and their consequences, both positive and negative. The review focuses on three key issues: the world’s capability to produce enough
food to feed humankind; the important roles played in shaping globalization by transnational corporations, global finance, and government policies; and the emerging challenges to globalization. The first of these addresses the current debate regarding whether it is possible to maintain ecological diversity while producing sufficient food to feed the world. The other issue acknowledges that outcomes of global processes are spatially uneven and strongly contested by forms of agriculture antithetical to the homogenized, capitalist, neoliberal model associated with globalization.},

Temporal scale is habitat lifespan relative to the generation time of the organism, and spatial scale is the distance between habitat patches relative to the dispersal distance of the organism. A spatially explicit simulation model of population growth and dispersal was constructed for a population that is distributed on a grid. The grid contains two sorts of habitat, useable and nonuseable habitat; useable habitat occurs in habitat patches. Habitat patches are transient; they are “born” at random with a specified probability, and they exist for a specified length of time, the patch “lifespan.” Distance between patches is directly related to habitat patch size when the fraction of the grid in useable habitat is held constant. A factorial simulation experiment was conducted in which the fraction of the grid in useable habitat was held constant and patch lifespan, patch size, and species dispersal distance were varied. The relative importance of temporal scale (patch lifespan) and spatial scale (patch size, a surrogate for inter-patch distance per species dispersal distance) on regional population size was tested by analysis of variance. Population size increased with increasing temporal scale and decreased with increasing spatial scale. The effect of temporal scale far outweighed the effect of spatial scale. Implications for design of ecological research programmes are discussed.},

This analysis provides a holistic view of the composition of the biosphere and allows us to observe broad patterns over taxonomic categories, geographic locations, and trophic modes.A census of the biomass on Earth is key for understanding the structure and dynamics of the biosphere. However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ~550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (~450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (~2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (~70 Gt C) and archaea (~7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ~6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.},

  abstract  = {Many suggest we are approaching a sixth mass extinction event, and yet estimates of how many species exist, and thus how many might become extinct, vary by as much as an order of magnitude. There are few statistically robust methods to estimate global species richness, and here we introduce several new methods, including one that builds on the observation that larger species are often described before smaller species. We combine these, giving equal weight to each, to provide mean global species estimates for the most speciose order, class, and phylum on Earth, beetles, insects, and arthropods (terrestrial). We attempt to aid conservation planning by broadening the range of methods used and bringing greater stability to global estimates for these taxa.It has been suggested that we do not know within an order of magnitude the number of all species on Earth [May RM (1988) Science 241(4872):1441{\textendash}1449]. Roughly 1.5 million valid species of all organisms have been named and described [Costello MJ, Wilson S, Houlding B (2012) Syst Biol 61(5):871{\textendash}883]. Given Kingdom Animalia numerically dominates this list and virtually all terrestrial vertebrates have been described, the question of how many terrestrial species exist is all but reduced to one of how many arthropod species there are. With beetles alone accounting for about 40\% of all described arthropod species, the truly pertinent question is how many beetle species exist. Here we present four new and independent estimates of beetle species richness, which produce a mean estimate of 1.5 million beetle species. We argue that the surprisingly narrow range (0.9{\textendash}2.1 million) of these four autonomous estimates{\textemdash}derived from host-specificity relationships, ratios with other taxa, plant:beetle ratios, and a completely novel body-size approach{\textemdash}represents a major advance in honing in on the richness of this most significant taxon, and is thus of considerable importance to the debate on how many species exist. Using analogous approaches, we also produce independent estimates for all insects, mean: 5.5 million species (range 2.6{\textendash}7.8 million), and for terrestrial arthropods, mean: 6.8 million species (range 5.9{\textendash}7.8 million), which suggest that estimates for the world{\textquoteright}s insects and their relatives are narrowing considerably.},

Despite their small sizes and cumulative biomass, we suggest that these animals may commonly have important effects on carbon and nutrient cycling by modulating the quality and quantity of resources that enter the detrital food web, with consequences at the ecosystem level. These effects can occur through multiple pathways, including direct inputs of insect biomass, the transformation of detrital biomass, and the indirect effects of predators on herbivores and detritivores. In virtually all cases, the ecosystem effects of these pathways are ultimately mediated through interactions with plants and soil microbes. Merging our understanding of insect, plant and microbial ecology will offer a valuable way to better integrate community-level interactions with ecosystem processes.},

In a simple nonparametric regression problem, where such a function gives the mean of a Gaussian distribution for an observed response, a Gaussian process model can easily be implemented using matrix computations that are feasible for datasets of up to about a thousand cases. Hyperparameters that define the covariance function of the Gaussian process can be sampled using Markov chain methods. Regression models where the noise has a t distribution and logistic or probit models for classification applications can be implemented by sampling as well for latent values underlying the observations. Software is now available that implements these methods using covariance functions with hierarchical parameterizations. Models defined in this way can discover high-level properties of the data, such as which inputs are relevant to predicting the response.},

  abstract  = {With scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. Over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. However, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. This computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. It is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. With regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. Every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). The latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. Hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-Gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. We discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. We also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings. Finally, we illustrate the approach with simulated and real data sets.},

  abstract  = {We consider four categories or biological mechanisms of determinants which cause and maintain species diversity: niche relations, habitat diversity, mass effects and ecological equivalency. Two of these determinants are original to this paper: mass effect, the establishment of species in sites where they cannot be self-maintaining; and ecological equivalency, the coexistence of species with effectively identical niche and habitat requirements. The mode of action and ecological implications of each biological determinant are discussed using a schematic method for measuring alpha (community), beta (differentiation), and gamma (regional) diversities. The importance of mass effects and ecological equivalency to species richess is documented with several types of field data from Israel and California, U.S.A. Floristic richness and, in particular, the richness of floristic transitions, are discussed and interpreted by use of the biological determinants of diversity. Contact transition between distinct floras are rich predominantly because of mass effects. Transitions induced by marked environmental changes are rich because of the combined influences of habitat diversity and mass effects. The rate at which species richness increases with sample area is related to the combined effects of all four biological determinants. This complexity explains the failures of simple species-area models. The relative intensity of each determinant is related to area: niche relations are most important at within-community scales, habitat diversity most important at both within-community and landscape scales, and ecological equivalency most important at regional scales. We suggest that understanding patterns of species diversity will be enhanced by the partitioning of total species richness into the richness caused by each of the four ecologically distinct determinants of diversity.},

2. There was a preference for softer soils that were easier to dig within a site with a low overall density, but in much denser aggregations problems of maintaining the structural integrity of a nest led to the utilization of harder soils.

3. The thermal advantages of having a warm nest meant that the most suitable areas were those with a southern aspect and a slope that maximized the absorption of solar radiation.

4. Limited areas of substrate with the most desirable characteristics resulted in gregarious nesting (‘limited substrate hypothesis’).

  abstract  = {Marginal habitats such as hedgerows or roadsides become especially important for the conservation of biodiversity in highly modified landscapes. With concerns of a global pollination crisis, there is a need for improving pollinator habitat. Roadsides restored to native prairie vegetation may provide valuable habitat to bees, the most important group of pollinators. Such roadsides support a variety of pollen and nectar sources and unlike agricultural fields, are unplowed, and therefore can provide potential nesting sites for ground-nesting bees. To examine potential effects of roadside restoration, bee communities were sampled via aerial netting and pan trapping along roadside prairie restorations as well as roadsides dominated by non-native plants. Management of roadside vegetation via the planting of native species profoundly affected bee communities. Restored roadsides supported significantly greater bee abundances as well as higher species richness compared to weedy roadsides. Floral species richness, floral abundance, and percentage of bare ground were the factors that led to greater bee abundance and bee species richness along restored roadsides. Traffic and width of roadside did not significantly influence bees, suggesting that even relatively narrow verges near heavy traffic could provide valuable habitat to bees. Restored and weedy roadside bee communities were similar to the prairie remnant, but the prairie remnant was more similar in bee richness and abundance to restored roadsides. Restoring additional roadsides to native vegetation could benefit pollinator conservation efforts by improving habitat on the millions of acres of land devoted to roadsides worldwide, land that is already set aside from further development.},

  abstract = {We argue that population growth rate is the key unifying variable linking the various facets of population ecology. The importance of population growth rate lies partly in its central role in forecasting future population trends; indeed if the form of density dependence were constant and known, then the future population dynamics could to some degree be predicted. We argue that population growth rate is also central to our understanding of environmental stress: environmental stressors should be defined as factors which when first applied to a population reduce population growth rate. The joint action of such stressors determines an organism's ecological niche, which should be defined as the set of environmental conditions where population growth rate is greater than zero (where population growth rate = r = loge(Nt+1/Nt)). While environmental stressors have negative effects on population growth rate, the same is true of population density, the case of negative linear effects corresponding to the well–known logistic equation. Following Sinclair, we recognize population regulation as occurring when population growth rate is negatively density dependent. Surprisingly, given its fundamental importance in population ecology, only 25 studies were discovered in the literature in which population growth rate has been plotted against population density. In 12 of these the effects of density were linear; in all but two of the remainder the relationship was concave viewed from above. Alternative approaches to establishing the determinants of population growth rate are reviewed, paying special attention to the demographic and mechanistic approaches. The effects of population density on population growth rate may act through their effects on food availability and associated effects on somatic growth, fecundity and survival, according to a 'numerical response', the evidence for which is briefly reviewed. Alternatively, there may be effects on population growth rate of population density in addition to those that arise through the partitioning of food between competitors; this is 'interference competition'. The distinction is illustrated using a replicated laboratory experiment on a marine copepod, Tisbe battagliae. Application of these approaches in conservation biology, ecotoxicology and human demography is briefly considered. We conclude that population regulation, density dependence, resource and interference competition, the effects of environmental stress and the form of the ecological niche, are all best defined and analysed in terms of population growth rate.},

A 10:1 ratio of male sterile line (A-line) to pollen parent was employed. Leaf cutter bees (Megachile rotundata F.) were used as the pollen vector between the two parents. In 1986, no significant differences in total seed yield were found among A-line rows, while in 1987, significant differences in total seed yields of A-line rows were found. Differences in hybrid seed yields among A-line rows were significant for all locations and years. Leaf cutter bees were found to be effective pollinators of the A-line plants. Less than half and less than a third of the seed produced on the A-line rows in 1986 and 1987, respectively, was hybrid seed. The high percentage of non-hybrid seed present in the seed lot may have been due to incomplete male sterility of the Marnoo A-line population. Total seed yields, hybrid seed yields and percent hybridity all declined linearly as distance from the pollen source increased. Improvement in the degree of male sterility of the Marnoo A-line population and/or a reduction in the 10:1 ratio of parents, and subsequent maximum A-line row to R-line row distance, will be necessary if hybrid summer rape seed production using this pol CMS A-line is to be commercially viable},

In both natural environments and those in which landmarks (environmental features protruding above the herb layer) were removed, there was a significant inverse relationship between residence time per flowering head and distance of the next inter-plant flight made. However, bumble bees moved differently in areas containing landmarks versus uniform flower stands in two respects: 1) Inter-plant flight distances were significantly longer in uniform areas. 2) Significantly fewer backwards-oriented flights were made in uniform areas. Thus, bumble bees are likely to move more rapidly through uniform habitats than those with boundary or landmark features. Studies of optimal foraging behavior in pollinators, and gene flow in the plants that they service, should consider more comprehensively the range of habitats in which the organisms are found.},

However, empirical evidence to support this prediction is scarce. We investigated the influences of semi-natural habitats and nesting resources on concentration effect and waylaying effect of bees, as well as their consequences on crop pollination in landscapes. Ninety-seven vetch patches with independent gradients of size and distances to nesting sites were selected from 11 agricultural landscapes with independent gradients of surrounding semi-natural habitats and nesting resources. Semi-natural habitats and nesting resources were quantified either by field inspections or from satellite images; flower visitor densities and vetch pollination services were measured across overall flowering seasons. The proportion of semi-natural habitats did not modify the concentration effect or waylaying effect of the abundant and highly social honey bees or the solitary species Anthophora waltoni. The increase in area of brick walls, acting as nesting resources of A. waltoni, increased the concentration effect and the waylaying effect. For other solitary bees, the proportion of semi-natural habitats and the proportion of buildings did not influence the concentration effect or the waylaying effect. Honey bee density, A. waltoni density and other solitary bee density positively predict vetch pollination services. The landscape-modified concentration effect and waylaying effect cascaded to vetch pollination by modifying A. waltoni density. Our findings indicated that landscape composition could modify the spatial foraging patterns of bees and influence pollination services provided to crops, but those varied among different taxonomic groups.},

  abstract  = {1. Many questions in ecology and evolutionary biology consider response variables that are functions (e.g. species-abundance distributions) rather than a single scalar value (e.g. species richness). Although methods for analysing function-valued data have been available for several decades, ecological and evolutionary applications are rare.
2. We outline methods for regression when the response variable is a function (‘function regression') and introduce the r package FREE, which focuses on straightforward implementation and interpretation of function regression analyses. Several computational methods are implemented, including machine learning and several Bayesian methods. We compare different methods using simulated data and real ecological data on individual-size distributions (ISDs) of fish and trees.
3. No single method performed best overall, with several performing equally well for a given data set. Which method to use depends on sample sizes and the questions being considered; in many cases, a consensus approach should be used to combine or compare fitted models.
4. Function regression allows the direct modelling of many function-valued data (e.g. species-abundance distributions) rather than having to reduce those functions to a single scalar response variable (e.g. species diversity or functional diversity indices). Our ecological examples using ISD data show that larger rivers support more-even fish-size distributions than smaller rivers and that low initial planting densities lead to more-even tree-size distributions than high initial planting densities. Function regression provided more informative and intuitive interpretations of these data than conventional non-function-valued approaches.},

  abstract  = {Globally, agriculture increasingly depends on pollinators to produce many seed and fruit crops. However, what constitutes optimal pollination service for pollinator-dependent crops remains unanswered. We developed a simulation model to identify the optimal pollination service that maximizes fruit quality in crops. The model depicts the pollination (i.e., autonomous self-fertilization, pollen deposition) and post-pollination (i.e., pollen germination, and time from germination to ovule fertilization) processes leading to fruit and seed set and allows for negative flower–pollinator interactions, specifically pistil damage. We parameterized and validated the model based on empirical observations of commercial raspberry in western Argentina. To assess the effects of pollination intensity for fruit production, we conducted simulations over a range of visit number per flower by the two primary managed pollinators worldwide, Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris. Simulations identified that ~15–35 visits per flower by A. mellifera or ~10–20 visits by B. terrestris provide adequate pollination and maximize raspberry fruit quality (i.e., estimated as the proportion of ovules that develop into drupelets). Visits in excess of these optima reduce simulated fruit quality, and flowers receiving >670 honey bee visits or >470 bumble bee visits would produce fruits of poorer quality than those receiving no bee visits. The simulations generated consistent, unbiased predictions of fruit quality for 12 raspberry fields. This model could be adapted easily to other animal-pollinated crops and used to guide efficient pollinator management in any agro-ecosystem.},

  abstract  = {Female bees store scattered pollens grains from their bodies for transport by different modes of grooming and pollen packing. Species with corbiculae, such as honey or bumble bees, compress grains into dense pellets borne on the hind tibiae. Other species sweep grains into local concentrations of hairs (scopae), typically around the legs (in Halictidae and Andrenidae) or the ventral abdomen (Megachilidae), in which grains remain loose. Do these modes of pollen packing affect the functional value of pollen? We transferred grains from the bodies of four groups of bees—the corbiculate bees: Bombus impatiens and Apis mellifera, and the non-corbiculate bees: Megachile rotundata and Halictus spp.—onto previously unvisited stigmas of Brassica rapa. We wiped corbicular or scopal pollen and body pollen from each bee’s body separately and measured the resulting fruit set and the number of seeds in successful fruits. The type of pollen significantly affected the number of fruits for the corbiculate bee species but not the non-corbiculate bees, and the type of pollen significantly affected the number of seeds in successful fruits for A. mellifera but not B. impatiens, M. rotundata, or Halictus spp. These results suggest that loose scopal pollen is fully functional, but corbicular pollen is sometimes impaired. In some situations, non-corbiculate bees may be more valuable pollinators than corbiculate species because their treatment of pollen leaves its capabilities intact.},

Development from prepupae to adults proceeds most rapidly at 32 degrees C., and is retarded when held at lower and higher temperatures.
Male behavior is distinct from that of the female. Mating, including the copulation process arid sleeping, are described.
Requirements necessary for nesting are presented. These included: types of nesting places, natural and artificial; size range of tunnels; and the effects of competition on nesting.
Females used leaf sections from a variety of plant species in construction of their cells. Description included desirable leaf characteristics, cutting procedures used to remove leaf sections from
plants and return of bees to given leaf sources. The construction of the cell cup is detailed as to leaf placement, number of leaves used, cell dimensions, and arrangement of cells under various nesting conditions.
After formation of the cell cup it is provisioned with pollen and nectar. Procedures of pollen collection, removal of pollen from the scopa, and the use of nectar for moistening the pollen mass were included as were descriptions of oviposition and cell capping. Upon completion of a cell series, the entrance to the tunnel was sealed, using leaf cuttings.
All procedures of cell construction were influenced by the age of the bee and behavioral changes noted toward the end of the flight season.
It was found that orientation to the nesting site is largely through visual association with gross characteristics of the area and that markers aided in orientation. Preliminary observations on color discrimination indicated that bees could distinguish between colors.
Foraging studies were conducted in the presence and absence of alfalfa and included notes on flower preference and pollen collecting.
Flight range studies indicated that bees forage plants closest to their nesting site and increase their range as close bloom is no longer available.
Attempts made to relocate bees in new areas met with only limited success.
Morning and evening behavior of bees were characterized and climatic conditions responsible for commencement and cessation of flight outlined.},

  abstract  = {Honey-bees foraging in a specially planted flower garden were chloroformed and given individual marks. Their movements were then recorded from day to day, and a few selected bees were watched continuously for periods of a day or more. It was concluded that: 1. The basic principle underlying the foraging behaviour pattern is the continuous exercise of choice by the bee, which chooses the best portions of the best of any alternative crops with which she becomes acquainted, and compares present crops with her memory of past crops. 2. Bees usually attach themselves to a particular area of the most suitable crop found. The size of this foraging area varies considerably. 3. Examples are given of the use of choice and memory in order to select the most suitable blossoms of the crop which is being worked, when showing a preference for different portions of a foraging area at different times, in order gradually to change the position of a foraging area, when a bee is working one crop and inspecting another, when she is working two crops at once, when she is working two crops at different times of the day, when crops are failing, and when changing crops. The centripetal tendency shown by some foragers is considered to be a consequence of the interplay of choice and memory. 4. Attachment may be of any duration, from a few trips to a lifetime. The proportion of changes of attachment may be expected to vary greatly with local circumstances, because behaviour is labile and readily adaptable to changing conditions. 5. Bees which became attached to sources yielding pollen without nectar remained for only a part of their foraging life. Bees were frequently seen to change their attachment from a pollen crop to a nectar crop, but never vice versa. 6. Nectar gatherers were observed to make from 250 to 1446 flower visits per load, and from about 300 to 1000 flower visits per foraging hour. Pollen gatherers averaged from 7 to 120 flower visits per load, and from about 50 to 150 fruitful flower visits per foraging hour. These limits may possibly be widely exceeded in other circumstances. Such statistics are not an index of the pollinating capacity of the bee, as foraging is often mainly composed of oft-repeated visits to favourite blossoms. The size of foraging area is a more correct index of pollinating capacity.},

  abstract  = {Field shelterbelts increase yields of field and forage crops throughout the world. The increases are due to reduced wind erosion, improved microclimate, snow retention and reduced crop damage by high winds. Crops differ in their responsiveness to shelter. Of the field and forage crops tested, winter wheat, barley, rye, millet, alfalfa and hay (mixed grasses and legumes) appear to be highly responsive to protection, while spring wheat, oats and corn respond to a lesser degree. Shelterbelt height and longevity, field width and shelterbelt orientation are major considerations in determining the effect of shelterbelts on crop yields. Precipitation has an effect on the percentage yield increase reported. Generally, percentage yield increases due to shelterbelts have been higher in drier regions or in drier years. By proper shelterbelt design and maintenance and the use of responsiveness crops, shelterbelt benefits to crop yields can be optimized.},

  abstract  = {Shelterbelts planted to control wind erosion indirectly affect the adjacent crop. Yield data were collected during 3 yr from 15 fields cropped mainly to spring wheat seeded on fallow, to quantify the competition and sheltering effects of the shelterbelts (about 6 m high and 200 m apart) and to relate these to microclimate and plant-available soil N, P and water. In 1989 and 1990, when moisture conditions during the growing season were dry and close to average, respectively, competition by the trees and their approximately 5-m-wide grass edge reduced crop yield about 10 m into the field. Yields were slightly above the field mean about 10–20 m from the field edge. The competition effect was smaller and the zone of improved crop growth was absent in 1991 when water was abundant. Plant-available N and P were close to the field means at the edge of the cultivated fields and were highest about 10 m into the fields. Competition for water is believed to be the main reason for the reduced yields at the edge of the fields as most farmers seed-placed fertilizer P, and response to added fertilizer N appeared independent of distance from the shelterbelt. Competition for water occurs during the growing period of the crop, but also includes water taken up by the shelterbelt when the field is in fallow. The improved crop growth 10–20 m from the field edge appears related to the reduction in potential evaporation as distance to the shelterbelt decreases.},

It has previously been suggested that avoidance of visited flowers for a fixed period would be a poor strategy, since different plant species vary greatly in the rate at which they replenish floral rewards. In this study, we examined the duration of flower repellency after an initial bumblebee visit, using wild bumblebees (Bombus lapidarius, B. pascuorum and B. terrestris) foraging on four different plant species (Lotus corniculatus, Melilotus officinalis, Phacelia tanacetifolia and Symphytum officinale). We constructed a model to predict flower visitation following an initial visit, based on the nectar secretion pattern of the different plant species, the insect visitation rate per flower, and the search and handling times of bumblebees foraging on the plant species in question. The model predicts an optimal duration of flower avoidance which maximises the rate of reward acquisition for all bees. However, this optimum may be open to cheating. For two plant species, the evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) is a shorter duration of flower avoidance than the optimum. We found the duration of flower avoidance was markedly different among flower species and was inversely related to nectar secretion rates. The predicted ESSs for each plant species were close to those observed, suggesting that the key parameters influencing bumblebee behaviour are those included in the model. We discuss how bees may alter the duration of their response to repellent scents, and other factors that affect flower re-visitation.},

Flower age was an important correlate of secretion rate: 4 h- and 7 h-old flowers had higher secretion rates than older and younger flowers. Flower stage also explained significant variation in secretion rate, but less than age, with which it was correlated. Although secretion rates varied significantly with flower stage, standing crops did not, suggesting higher rates of depletion in flowers with higher secretion rates. The flower-probing choices of honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble bees (Bombus spp.) on first arrival on an inflorescence were recorded. Bees probed flowers in rapidly-secreting flower stages more often than would be expected by chance. These findings support the argument that if the probability of a visit to a given flower at a given time depends on its nectar content at that time (the standing crop), the number of visits received by that flower over a given interval depends on its secretion rate. In the case of P. tanacetifolia, the visitation rate changes over the life of a flower, as its secretion rate changes.},

Clonally replicated representative selections of "alfalfa conference" breeding stocks were planted in replicated randomized blocks in field and greenhouse. 2. Honeybee visitation was associated with nectar production per plant on field-grown plants (r = +.566**) and on greenhouse-grown material (r = +.693**). Nectar production and seed production were also correlated (r = +.580*). On the basis of the nectar per flower the correlation with bee visitors was +.024 and with seed was +.432; neither was significant. On the average a plant produced about 11,000 flowers and 6.6 gm. of nectar sugar. 3. Seed production and bee visitation were positively correlated regardless of whether the pollinators were restricted to nectar collectors (r = +.887**) or whether conditions were natural (r = +.652**). The relationship is independent of the effects of plants and replications as indicated by error-line correlation coefficients of +.394** and +.530** for natural pollination and nectar-collector pollination, respectively. Adjustment of seed yields to uniform bee visitation did not account for all the variation, since the seed yields were still significantly different after adjustment. An inherent difference in the response of the plants to bee visitation is indicated. 4. Average seed production per plant was 17.2 gm. with a range from 8.8 to 44.8 gm. The 400% range suggests a good possibility of improvement by breeding for this character. 5. Preliminary progeny tests for nectar production per flower were conducted, using polycross progenies and selfs and crosses involving high and low nectar producers. Average values for twenty-four-plant polycross progenies for nectar volume were positively correlated with nectar production of their maternal parents in the previous year where the nectar per flower was considered (r = +.833**). A range of 0.06-2.93 mg. of sugar per flower was obtained for individual plants in the progenies. 6. Average values of the reciprocal crosses of a high and a low nectar producer were 0.81 and 0.82 mg. of sugar per flower, but only two plants were available on one side of the cross. Multifactorial inheritance was postulated on the basis of the normal frequency distributions obtained. 7. Self-pollination of a low nectar producer gave low-producing progeny. Self-pollination of a high nectar producer gave high-producing progeny. A difference of 0.71 mg. of sugar per flower between the parents of a high and of a low nectar producer was reduced to 0.51 in the selfed progenies. Crossing a high nectar producer with a low nectar producer gave a progeny that was intermediate. Two crosses involving a high nectar producer with two high seed-producing clones were made. The average difference of the parents in the two crosses was 0.07 mg., and the average difference of the progenies was 0.10 mg. of sugar per flower. The parental advantage was maintained in the progeny.},

  abstract  = {I examined the response of bumblebees to two kinds of spatial variation and two kinds of temporal variation in nectar levels. The spatial variation involved differences in reward value among plant species and differences in nectar availability among patches of flowers of a single species. The temporal variation involved changes in nectar availability over a season and between years. In all cases the response of bees was measured by differences in bee density or abundance. The response of bees of different plant species was determined by the density of foraging bees on the flowers of each species at a given time (bee:flower ratio = B/F). I examined several groups of plant species whose members overlapped in their flowering periods and in their bumblebee visitors. Within a group, the relative magnitudes of the B/F's for species indicate the degree to which their flowers are preferred by bees. If bees are optimal foragers, preference should reflect the per-flower reward value of species. I characterized the potential reward value of species by their nectar production rates (NPR's). The bees' preference for species was found to be very similar to the relative magnitudes of their NPR's. I also considered whether including the time and energy costs of foraging on the different species would produce a better predictor of preference. While these factors did affect the absolute reward value of species they did not influence their reward value relative to one another. Foraging costs are most likely to have no effect on preference when species have similar floral morphologies. To assess the response of bees to differences in patch quality I bagged some of the inflorescenes in an experimental patch. Following this reduction in the number of flowers, the number of bees in the patch decreased proportionately, producing a B/F very similar to that of a control patch. When the bagging was removed the number of bees increased such that the B/F was again similar to that of the control patch. In general these results provide further support for optimal foraging in bumblebees. I examined the response of bees to temporal variation in nectar levels to determine whether resource limitation for bumblebees change over time. Seasonal changes in the abundances of three bumblebee species were compared with seasonal changes in the total nectar production by the plants each bee visited. Preference factors were used to convert floral production to nectar production. In general, seasonal production and utilization were closely matched, indicating no major change in nectar limitation. The cumulative numbers of bees seen during each of two summer seasons (1974 and 1975) were very similar. This indicates that the resource base, which had not changed between years, was capable of supporting only a limited number of bees. During 1975 a natural species removal experiment occurred which allowed an assessment of competition among bees. Apis mellifera, which had been well represented in 1974, was absent. The bumblebees of short and medium tongue length with which honeybees overlapped in resource used exhibited competitive release. Their abundances increased in 1975 resulting in near-perfect density compensation.},

  abstract  = {A honeybee’s waggle dance is an intriguing example of multisensory convergence, central processing and symbolic information transfer. It conveys to bees and human observers the position of a relatively small area at the endpoint of an average vector in a two-dimensional system of coordinates. This vector is often computed from a collection of waggle phases from the same or different dancers. The question remains, however, of how informative a small sample of waggle phases can be to the bees, and how the spatial information encoded in the dance is actually mapped to the followers’ searches in the field. Certainly, it is the variability of a dancer’s performance that initially defines the level of uncertainty that followers must cope with if they were to successfully decode information in the dance. Understanding how a dancer’s behaviour is mapped to that of its followers initially relies on the analysis of both the accuracy and precision with which the dancer encodes spatial information in the dance. Here we describe within-individual variations in the encoding of the distance to and direction of a goal. We show that variations in the number of a dancer’s wagging movements, a measure that correlates well with the distance to the goal, do not depend upon the dancer’s travelled distance, meaning that there is a constant variance of wagging movements around the mean. We also show
that the duration of the waggle phases and the angular dispersion and divergence of successive waggle phases co-vary with a dancer’s orientation in space. Finally, using data from dances recorded through high-speed video techniques, we present the first analysis of the accuracy and precision with which an increasing number of waggle phases conveys spatial information to a human observer.},

  abstract  = {Many social insect species that employ directional recruitment to food finds communicate the location of their targets with seemingly needless imprecision. Here we present evidence that the spatial precision of the honey bees' dance communication has been “tuned” by selection so that recruits are neither so accurate that they usually find areas which have already been depleted nor so inaccurate that they usually fail to find the advertised resources altogether. First, the bees' distance errors are similar in magnitude to their directional errors, and their angular errors decrease greatly with increasing distance to the target (decreasing more than fourfold between 100 and 700 m). As a result, the absolute scatter of recruits remains relatively constant with changing distance to the target (increasing by less than 50% between 100 and 700 m). This is to be expected if the optimal level of imprecision is the same for distance and direction and does not change with the distance of the target from the nest. Second, comparative studies involving three tropical- and one temperate-zone species (all Apis)suggest that the precision of the bees' languages may have been tuned in accordance with the spatial characteristics of the resources each species uses. We suggest that both the round dance, which conveys no directional information for nearby targets, and the high angular divergence in waggle dances indicating targets within several hundred meters of the colony are both understandable in this context.},

These results imply that the foraging paths of bumblebees may be determined, in part, by a tendency to visit nearest inflorescences. The distribution of turning angles from individual rather than pooled data, however, suggest that active selection of inflorescences with between two and six flowers may also play a role in determining the foraging path. I found no evidence for area-restricted foraging. This may be due to the heterogeneity of the natural resource patches.},

A dancing bee communicates the location of a profitable food source and its odour. Followers may often experience situations in which dancers indicate an unfamiliar location but carry the scent of a flower species the followers experienced previously at different locations. Food scents often reactivate bees to resume food collection at previously visited food patches. This double function of the dance creates a conflict between the social vector information and the private navigational information. We investigated which kind of information followers with field experience use in this situation and found that followers usually ignored the spatial information encoded by the waggle dance even if they followed a dance thoroughly (five waggle runs or more). They relied on private information about food source locations instead (in 93% of all cases). Furthermore, foragers preferred to follow dancers carrying food odours they knew from previous field trips, independently of the spatial information encoded in the dance. Surprisingly, neither odour identity nor the location indicated by the dancer was an important factor for the reactivation success of a dance. Our results contrast with the assumption that (i) followers usually try to decode the vector information and (ii) dances indicating an unfamiliar location are of little interest to experienced foragers.},

3. Across 27 farms, we found that bird species richness and the relative abundance of insectivorous birds increased, while the relative abundance of strawberry-eating birds and bird damage decreased on farms with more semi-natural land cover in the surrounding landscapes (1000 m radius).
4. Relative to homogeneous farms, those that implemented diversification practices, such as hedgerows, flower strips or increased crop diversity, had greater bird species richness, total relative abundance, insectivore abundance and strawberry-eating bird abundance.
5.Synthesis and applications. Conserving semi-natural land cover in the surrounding landscape benefits bird species richness locally and aids farmers through reduced abundance of strawberry-eating birds and bird damage. These results highlight the need to consider both the services and disservices of birds when making management decisions.},

  abstract  = {1. To quantify the effect of the surrounding landscape context on a biological response at a site, most studies measure landscape variables within discs centred on this biological response (threshold-based method, TBM). This implicitly assumes that the effect of a unit area of the landscape is consistent up to a threshold distance beyond which it drops to zero. However, it seems more likely that the landscape effect declines with increasing distance from the biological response point. Here, we develop a method to quantify landscape context effects by weighting the landscape variables by functions that decrease with distance. We illustrate the method using abundance data on birds and insects, and compare the results to the threshold approach.
2. We defined distance weighting functions by the function family (e.g. negative exponential, Gaussian…) and by the parameters for this function. We developed a method to simultaneously estimate the parameters characterizing the effect of the landscape variables and the parameters of the best weighting functions. For each test dataset, we determined which weighting function (family and parameters) had the most support, by optimizing the model AIC.
3. The distance-weighted method (DWM) improved model support over the TBM in three of four datasets, with the exponential power function selected as the best weighing function in all three cases.
4. The observed differences between estimations of landscape context effects by the distance-weighted and the threshold methods have significant implications for landscape management. For example, the DWM suggests that managing a landscape for 90% of its effect on a focal population requires an area over five times larger than the area estimated by the threshold method, a situation that might apply for priority conservation of few remnant populations of a severely endangered species. In contrast, management for 30% of the landscape effect requires only about half the area estimated using the threshold method, a situation that might apply to a management situation with limited resources or low political/societal support.
5. The DWM is applicable to any species-habitat relationship. More comparisons are needed to determine the situations in which distance-weighted estimation of landscape context effects is warranted over the simpler threshold method.},

But, if individuals are genetically related, this simple fitness–maximization mechanism breaks down. Habitat occupation should obey Hamilton's rule (natural selection favours traits causing a loss in individual fitness as long as they result in an equal or greater gain in inclusive fitness) and depends more on inclusive fitness than it does on individual fitness. We demonstrate that the resulting inclusive–fitness distribution inflates the population density in habitats of poorer inherent quality, creating pronounced source–sink dynamics. We also show that density–dependent habitat selection among relatives reinforces behaviours such as group defence and interspecific territoriality, and that it explains many anomalies in dispersal and foraging.},

I use the example of patch exploitation decisions in this article in order to develop several key points about the properties of naturally occurring foraging decisions. First, I argue that experimental preparations based on binary, mutually exclusive choice are not good models of foraging decisions. Instead, foraging choices have a sequential foreground-background structure, in which one option is in the background of all other options. Second, behavioral ecologists view foraging as a hierarchy of decisions that range from habitat selection to food choice. Finally, data suggest that foraging animals are sensitive to several important trade-offs. These trade-offs include the effects of competitors and group mates, as well as the problem of predator avoidance.},

The patterns of abundance among regions were very similar among years, suggesting that the abundance of bumble bees is controlled by weather–related factors, even though analyses of the temperature and precipitation during summer, winter, and the spring periods when queens are establishing new colonies did not reveal any relationships.},

  abstract  = {The phenological relationships between nesting behavior of a specialist, solitary bee, Dieunomia triangulifera, and the flowering of its primary pollen source, Helianthus annuus, were studied for 3 yr at a site in northeastern Kansas, which contained between 50 000 and >150 000 nests. Activity patterns of D. triangulifera are closely synchronized with pollen availability on nearby sunflower plants in three ways: (1) each year, D. triangulifera became active within days of the beginning of the local sunflower bloom, and the emergence schedule of the entire population at the nest site was timed such that all females had constructed nests and were collecting pollen at peak bloom; (2) over a season the greatest numbers of provisioning females were active at peak bloom, when pollen was most abundant; and (3) over the day, females made more trips, each of which took less time when pollen was most abundant on nearby flowers than when it was scarce. Between seasons, female reproductive success varied positively with the availability of H. annuus pollen. When pollen was abundant, and the population at the nest site was low, @?3 times more cells were provisioned than the following year when the bee population was high and pollen abundance declined. Furthermore, 20 pollen-collecting bee species (10 specialists and 10 generalists), besides D. triangulifera, used an estimated 68% of the available sunflower pollen at this site. These data suggest that resource limitation is important in shaping patterns of provisioning behavior in D. triangulifera. Other behaviors presumably related to reproductive success were variable and suggest resources were not limiting: (1) all females did not forage on each day, even at peak bloom; (2) variance in both trip durations and the numbers of trips made per day was large; and (3) females produced far fewer eggs in their lifetime than apparently possible. We suggest that the apparently conflicting evidence for resource limitation may be explained by a physiological limit on the rate of egg production; in such a case, the effects of resource limitation, while clearly important, might not be the primary factor limiting reproductive output. Female D. triangulifera benefit by being synchronized with their resource. Daily and seasonal synchrony enable females to collect a greater amount of pollen during shorter foraging trips. The translates into higher mean reproductive success and, at the population level, allows more females to be supported by the pollen produced from nearby plants. In short, those females that are synchronized with the sunflower bloom effectively increase their own resource availability. This phenomenon may be general, especially in short-lived organisms, i.e., the evolution of specialization may be associated with fitness benefits based on synchrony with a preferred food source.},

Additionally, the numbers of the parasitoids Nomada lathburiana and Bombylius major were estimated. For calculations of the daily population size, the Jolly-Seber model for open populations with time-dependent survival and capture rates was used. The mean daily population size corresponded well to the number of nests marked in the aggregation of A. vaga. The method of mark-recapture achieved the most accurate data when the number of sampling periods and the capture probability was high. The results document a decrease in population size of the investigated A. vaga aggregation during 4 successive years. A population increase of its parasitoids B. major is considered to be one reason for the population decline of A. vaga in 1999. The sex ratio of A. vaga was biased toward females, contrary to the expected higher number of males. Results of the mark-recapture studies showed that up to 50% of females left the aggregation or died at the beginning of the season. The females probably colonized new aggregations at distances further than 200 m away from their birth aggregation, as no marked females were observed in the environs of the study area. This behavior is interpreted as a parasite avoidance strategy. The bee populations in the study area form a web of interconnected aggregations. Apparently a flux of extinction and recolonization exists between the different aggregations.},

However, we still have limited understanding of how landscape complexity shapes pollinator communities in both crop and non-crop habitat, and whether pollinator responses to landscape complexity vary with their association with mass-flowering crops. Here, we surveyed pollinator communities on mass-flowering leek crops and in nearby semi-natural habitat in landscapes of varying complexity. Surveys were done before and during crop bloom and distinguished between pollinators that visit the crop frequently (dominant), occasionally (opportunistic), or not at all (non-crop). Forty-seven per cent of the species in the wider landscape were also observed on leek flowers. Crop pollinator richness increased with local pollinator community size and increasing landscape complexity, but relationships were stronger for opportunistic than for dominant crop pollinators. Relationships between pollinator richness in semi-natural habitats and landscape complexity differed between groups with the most pronounced positive effects on non-crop pollinators. Our results indicate that while dominant crop pollinators are core components of crop pollinator communities in all agricultural landscapes, opportunistic crop pollinators largely determine species-richness responses and complex landscapes are local hotspots for both biodiversity conservation and potential ecosystem service provision.},

Relative to the median, a 25% improvement of plant quality and pollination increased crop value by an estimated $18 007 and $17 174 ha-1 respectively. Across five crop lines, bumblebees delivered most pollination services, while other wild pollinator groups made less frequent but nevertheless substantial contributions.

We attempt to provide a robust baseline for protein levels bees can collect in- (crop and weed species) and off-field (wild plants) in agricultural habitats around the globe. Using this dataset we identify crops which provide sub-optimal pollen resources in terms of crude protein concentration for bees and suggest potential plant genera that could serve as alternative resources for protein. This information could be used by scientists, regulators, bee keepers, NGOs and farmers to compare the pollen quality currently offered in alternative foraging habitats and identify opportunities to improve them. In the long run, we hope that additional markers of pollen quality will be added to the database in order to get a more complete picture of flower resources offered to bees and foster a data-informed discussion about pollinator conservation in modern agricultural landscapes.},

  abstract  = {There is growing concern that some bee populations are in decline, potentially threatening pollination security in agricultural and non-agricultural landscapes. Among the numerous causes associated with this trend, nutritional stress resulting from a mismatch between bee nutritional needs and plant community provisioning has been suggested as one potential driver. To ease nutritional stress on bee populations in agricultural habitats, agri-environmental protection schemes aim to provide alternative nutritional resources for bee populations during times of need. However, such efforts have focused mainly on quantity (providing flowering plants) and timing (during flower-scarce periods), while largely ignoring the quality of the offered flower resources. In a first step to start addressing this information gap, we have used literature data to compile a comprehensive geographically explicit dataset on nectar quality (i.e., total sugar concentration), offered to bees both within fields (crop and weed species) as well as outside fields (wild species) around the globe. Social bees are particularly sensitive to nectar sugar concentrations, which directly impact calorie influx into the colony and consequently their fitness making it an important resource quality marker. We find that the total nectar sugar concentrations in general do not differ between the three plant communities studied. In contrast we find increased variability in nectar quality in the wild plant community compared to crop and weed community, which is likely explained by the increased phylogenetic diversity in this category of plants. In a second step we explore the influence of local habitat on nectar quality and its variability utilizing a detailed sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) data set and find that geography has a small, but significant influence on these parameters. In a third step we identify crop groups (genera), which provide sub-optimal nectar resources for bees and suggest high quality alternatives as potential nectar supplements. In the long term this data set could serve as a starting point to systematically collect more quality characteristics of plant provided resources to bees, which ultimately can be utilized by scientist, regulators, NGOs and farmers to improve the flower resources offered to bees. We hope that ultimately this data will help to ease nutritional stress for bee populations and foster a data informed discussion about pollinator conservation in modern agricultural landscapes.},

  abstract  = {The global increase in the proportion of land cultivated with pollinator-dependent crops implies increased reliance on pollination services. Yet agricultural practices themselves can profoundly affect pollinator supply and pollination. Extensive monocultures are associated with a limited pollinator supply and reduced pollination, whereas agricultural diversification can enhance both. Therefore, areas where agricultural diversity has increased, or at least been maintained, may better sustain high and more stable productivity of pollinator-dependent crops. Given that >80% of all crops depend, to varying extents, on insect pollination, a global increase in agricultural pollinator dependence over recent decades might have led to a concomitant increase in agricultural diversification. We evaluated whether an increase in the area of pollinator-dependent crops has indeed been associated with an increase in agricultural diversity, measured here as crop diversity, at the global, regional, and country scales for the period 1961–2016. Globally, results show a relatively weak and decelerating rise in agricultural diversity over time that was largely decoupled from the strong and continually increasing trend in agricultural dependency on pollinators. At regional and country levels, there was no consistent relationship between temporal changes in pollinator dependence and crop diversification. Instead, our results show heterogeneous responses in which increasing pollinator dependence for some countries and regions has been associated with either an increase or a decrease in agricultural diversity. Particularly worrisome is a rapid expansion of pollinator-dependent oilseed crops in several countries of the Americas and Asia that has resulted in a decrease in agricultural diversity. In these regions, reliance on pollinators is increasing, yet agricultural practices that undermine pollination services are expanding. Our analysis has thereby identified world regions of particular concern where environmentally damaging practices associated with large-scale, industrial agriculture threaten key ecosystem services that underlie productivity, in addition to other benefits provided by biodiversity.},

We hypothesize that this is caused by a lack of a large enough ecological contrast between AEM and non-treated control sites. The effectiveness of AEM may be moderated by landscape structure and land-use intensity. Here, we examined the influence of local ecological contrast, landscape structure and regional land-use intensity on AEM effectiveness in a meta-analysis of 62 European pollinator studies. We found that ecological contrast was most important in determining the effectiveness of AEM, but landscape structure and regional land-use intensity played also a role. In conclusion, the most successful way to enhance AEM effectiveness for pollinators is to implement measures that result in a large ecological improvement at a local scale, which exhibit a strong contrast to conventional practices in simple landscapes of intensive land-use regions.},

Understanding the details of how alfalfa plants grow will help farmers grow better alfalfa. Knowing how the alfalfa germinates will help them create conditions necessary for good stand establishment. Knowing how seedlings develop will be useful in determining when to control diseases, insects, and weeds. Understanding patterns of growth-spring green-up and growth after cutting-will aid in identifying winter injury and disease problems, and in managing weeds. And being familiar with the mature stages of alfalfa growth will be helpful when making decisions about when to cut to ensure the maximum yield of the forage quality required.},

Here, we investigate how a potentially important stabilising mechanism, response diversity, the differential response to environmental change among species, stabilises pollination services against land-use change. We measured crop pollination services provided by native bees across land-use gradients in three crop systems. We found that bee species responded differentially to increasing agricultural land cover in all three systems, demonstrating that response diversity occurs. Similarly, we found response diversity in pollination services in two of the systems. However, there was no evidence that response diversity, in general, stabilised ecosystem services. Our results suggest that either response diversity is not the primary stabilising mechanism in our system, or that new measures of response diversity are needed that better capture the stabilising effects it provides.},

  abstract  = {This review charts the use of the concept of harvest index in crop improvement and physiology, concentrating on the literature from the last 20 years. Evidence from abstract journals indicates that the term has been applied most to small grain cereal crops and pulses, in India, Western Europe and the USA, and that it has been less useful for maize and tuber crops. Standard methods of measuring harvest index, the associated problems of measurement and interpretation, and representative values for a range of world species are reviewed. The values for modern varieties of most intensively-cultivated grain crops fall within the range 0.4 to 0.6. Variation between varieties of the same species is illustrated by trends in the harvest indices of old, outclassed and recent varieties of temperate and mediterranean wheat and barley (compared under uniform conditions); this shows a progressive increase throughout the present century, although improvement has been much slower in Australia and Canada than in the UK. In most cases, the improvement in harvest index has been a consequence of increased grain population density coupled with stable individual grain weight. The high heritability of harvest index is explored by examining its (rather weak) response to variation in environmental factors (fertilisation, population density, application of growth regulators) in the absence of severe stress. A fuller perspective is gained by reviewing aspects of the harvest index of rice, maize and tropical pulses. With rice, attention must be paid to the fact that the adhering lemma and palea (not primarily part of economic yield) can make up 20% of grain weight; and there are important interactions among biomass, grain yield and season length. Maize differs from most small grain crops in that harvest index (in N. American varieties) was already high at the start of this century, and increases in yield potential have been largely the consequence of increased biomass production. The harvest index of many pulse species and varieties tends to be low because selection has been for some yield in all seasons. Extension of the harvest index concept to express the partitioning of mineral nutrients as well as dry matter (e.g. the nitrogen harvest index) has provided a range of responses whose implications for production and breeding remain to be explored. It is concluded that even though the principal cereal crops appear to be approaching the upper limit of harvest index, and future yield gains will have to be sought by increased biomass production, there will still be a need for the concept of harvest index as a tool in interpreting crop response to different environments and climatic change.},

A low percentage of bees (46–79% of released) survived the incubation and field-emergence processes; of those bees, the number of females that established at the nesting sites was 25–100%. Of the three field sites, one site consistently retained more females and produced more completed nests than the other sites, all of which usually had poor female establishment and progeny production. In addition, floral resources were depleted over time, but many flowers remained unvisited over the season. Nest production decreased over time, as numbers of flowers and female bees declined. Significant positive relationships were found between the intended stocking densities and 1) the number of females that actually survived incubation and field emergence and 2) the number of females that established nests. The number of females that established nests was positively affected by the number of females that survived to emerge in the field. The percentage of females that established was not significantly affected by the intended number of released bees, countering a prediction that the release of fewer bees would allow more females to establish nests and achieve high reproductive success. For growers, it may be more frugal to use modest numbers of M. rotundata for pollination, because many of the bees at medium and high stocking densities do not nest in grower-provided bee boards.},

However, demarcating arable land for conservation may reduce farm income. A conciliatory habitat management plan thus consists of planting harvestable commodities which offer pollinator resources. This study’s goal was to determine whether a single species annual flowering crop could support an abundant and diverse wild pollinator community despite its own uniformity. Local bee communities were sampled using pan traps and hand collection within sixty 10 m2 plots of a sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., field and thirty 10 m2 plots within a meadow three times throughout August, 2012. In total, 2316 bees were collected with Bombus impatiens Cresson constituting 81.5% of sampled bees. Examined collectively, hand collections yielded significantly higher bee abundances in the sunflower field (P < 0.01) across every sampling date. Conversely, an equivalent number of pan-trapped bees occurred among habitats for all sampling dates except week three (P = 0.02) when a greater abundance was observed in the sunflower habitat. Species diversity did not differ (Phand = 0.99, Ppan = 0.97) between habitats although community composition differed with high significance (P < 0.01) indicating that these habitats had comparable diversity levels but attracted particular bee assemblages. Our study identifies sunflower crops as useful pollinator resources, especially for Bombus species, and provides insight into single species annual crops’ potential contribution to pollinator conservation.},

Although accidental tripping of alfalfa by nectar-collecting honey bees is a major factor in the commercial production of seed in Utah and California, it is a minor one in southern Alberta because (a) the percentage of flowers tripped is lower than at more southern latitudes, probably because temperature and humidity conditions are not so conducive to automatic tripping, (b) fewer honey bees utilize alfalfa as a source of nectar because sweet clover is prevalent in this region; (c) there is less time for pollination of flowers and maturation of seed, and (d) much of the tripping does not result in cross-pollination, and, hence, fewer pods are formed per flower tripped and fewer seeds per pod. Conclusions drawn from data on seed yields will be erroneous if small populations of efficient native-bee pollinators are ignored where pollination activity of honey bees is low},

Westar summer rape was grown from seed to maturity in controlled environment chambers set at temperatures ranging from 10 to 25C. Plants representing each stage of leaf development were selected at random from the population for leaf area determination. Logistic equations were used to relate the area of individual leaves to Growing Degree Days (GDD). Polynomial regression equations were used to fit curves describing the relationship between LAmax, LAX, LAD and leaf position or air temperature. As the air temperature increased the LAmax increased. LAX increased to a maximum which occurred when LAmax was at its maximum. There were no significant differences for LAX among air temperatures ranging from 13.5 to 22 °C. Mean LAX was 0.21?cm2 GDD-1. There were no significant differences in LAD due to leaf position or air temperature. Mean LAD was 140.1?GDD.Key words: Leaf area, leaf expansion rate, leaf area duration, Brassica napus},

Our objective was to determine if seed lots from late October (fall) or early spring (April) seeding dates improve seed vigour relative to mid-May (May) seeding dates. We compared seed size, seed maturity, germination percentage, and seedling emergence under controlled-environment conditions from six seed lots obtained from fall-sown (1997, 1998), April-sown (1998, 1999) and May-sown canola (1998, 1999) cv. Quest. On average, 80% of fall-derived seed for both years was larger than 1.7 mm compared to only 32% for May-derived canola seed. April-derived seed was intermediate. Fall and April derived seed were considered 40% mature compared to 16% for May-derived seed. In germination tests at 8°C, May derived seed germinated and emerged slower with a lower total germination percentage compared to falland April-derived seed lots. Priming reduced differences in emergence between the seed lots. Field studies at Scott, SK, sown in the fall of 1999 and 2000, and in early May of 2000 demonstrated that seed derived from fall- and April-sown canola produced higher plant densities, higher biomass at bolting, and higher seed yield than seed derived from May-sown canola. Yield was 10 to 45% less from seed derived from May-sown canola than seed derived from fall- and April-sown canola. This study established the impact of seeding date on seed quality and vigour, which in turn affected emergence, seedling vigour and yield. Also, seed vigour slowly declined within 1 yr, primarily with seed derived from the May-sown canola.},

The often hypothesised trade-off between seed size and seed number was supported by a cross-species analysis and by an analysis of 35 phylogenetically independent contrasts, derived from a data-set of 72 species. Apart from among-species relatedness, we also controlled for possible confounding effect of plant size that may influence both seed size and seed number. A sowing experiment with 50 species was performed in the field. The seeds were sown in a grassland and subjected to two treatments, disturbance and undisturbed sward. Evidence for seed-limited recruitment was obtained for 45 of the species. Disturbance had a significant, or nearly significant, positive effect on recruitment for 16 of the 45 species. The relative recruitment in undisturbed sward increased with increased seed size, and both recruitment success and seedling size were positively related to seed size. We suggest that a trade-off between competitive ability and number of recruitment opportunities follows from the trade-off between seed size and seed number, through a causal chain from seed size via seedling size to recruitment success. The relationships between seed size, seed number and recruitment may be an important underlying mechanism for abundance and dynamics of plant species in grassland vegetation. This is an example of a direct link between evolutionary life-history theory, and theory of plant community structure.},

The largest single contributor to the present-day spread of seed mass was the divergence between angiosperms and gymnosperms, whereas the widest divergence was between Celastraceae and Parnassiaceae. Wide divergences in seed size were more often associated with divergences in growth form than with divergences in dispersal syndrome or latitude.

  abstract  = {Area and production of canola (Brassica napus L.) in the High Rainfall Zone (HRZ) of southern Australia has increased significantly over the past decade. Varieties available to growers have not been bred specifically for the HRZ and are generally adapted to the drier regions of the cropping belt. Field experiments were conducted at Hamilton in south-west Victoria in 2005, 2006 and 2008 to identify canola traits and management suited to the HRZ of southern Australia. Nine varieties with different reported maturities (winter and spring types) were sown at either two times of sowing and/or under different nitrogen (N) fertiliser regimes. Dates of key phenological development were recorded, dry matter was determined at bud, flowering and maturity and grain yield and yield components were determined at harvest. Plant traits and climate data were assessed in relation to grain yield. Yields of the winter types were either significantly (P?<?0.05) greater or not significantly less than the spring types in all 3 years and similar to those reported under experimental conditions in Europe. This was despite the winter types flowering up to 35 days later than the spring types and spring rainfall being approximately half that of the long-term average. In general, the winter types had greater early vigour, greater dry matter production at the bud, flowering and maturity stages and were taller than the spring types. Regression analysis showed positive relationships between grain yield and pod density and plant size (dry matter and plant height). Plant size was influenced by variety, time of sowing and N fertiliser application rates. Crops in the HRZ were able to sustain more seeds per pod at larger canopy sizes and pod densities than those achieved in the northern hemisphere. Despite the number of pods per g of dry matter at flowering being nearly double that reported in the UK, there was little apparent reduction in the number of seeds per pod. It is possible that higher solar radiation and warmer minimum temperatures in the HRZ of Australia provide conditions more favourable for growth before, and during grainfill. This indicates that different dry matter production and yield component targets may be appropriate for canola in this environment especially in more typical seasons. It is likely that growers will need to sow new, later maturing varieties earlier and with higher rates of N fertiliser than is current practice in Australia. This study indicates that winter types may have the potential to provide improvements to the yield of canola in the HRZ either through the direct importation of varieties from overseas or through the identification and incorporation of desired traits into existing material. It is recommended that a wider range of germplasm be assessed over a greater geographical area to identify traits and management practices to optimise phenology and canopy structure. This information can be used to help inform breeders on crop improvement priorities as well providing tailored management practices to maximise grain yields for this environment.},

We found that small-seeded species were more abundant in the seed rain than large-seeded species. However, this numerical advantage was lost by seedling emergence. The disadvantage of small-seeded species probably results from size-selective post-dispersal seed predation, or the longer time small-seeded species spend in the soil before germination. Seedlings from large-seeded species have higher survival through a given amount of time as seedlings. However, this advantage seems to be countered by the greater time taken for large-seeded species to reach reproductive maturity: our data suggested no relationship, or perhaps a weak negative relationship, between seed size and survival from seedling emergence through to adulthood. A previous compilation showed that the inverse relationship between seed mass and the number of seeds produced per unit canopy area per year is countered by positive relationships between seed mass, plant size and plant longevity. Taken together, these data show that our old understanding of a species’ seed mass as the result of a trade–off between producing a few large offspring, each with high survival probability, versus producing many small offspring each with a lower chance of successfully establishing was incomplete. It seems more likely that seed size evolves as part of a spectrum of life history traits, including plant size, plant longevity, juvenile survival rate and time to reproduction.},

Previous reviews of pollen supplementation experiments concluded that a majority of plant species suffers from pollen limitation and that its magnitude is high. Here, we perform a meta-analysis and find evidence that publication bias, experimental design, and the response variable chosen all influence the magnitude of pollen limitation. Fail-safe numbers indicate that publication bias exists for some measures of pollen limitation; significant results are more likely to be published and therefore available for review. Moreover, experiments conducted on only a fraction of a plant's flowers and reproductive episodes report ~8-fold higher effect sizes than those on all flowers produced over the entire lifetime, likely because resource reallocation among flowers and across years contributes to estimates of pollen limitation. Studies measuring percentage fruit set report higher values of pollen limitation than those measuring other response variables, such as seeds per fruit, perhaps because many plant species will not produce fruits unless adequate pollen receipt occurs to fertilize most ovules. We offer suggestions for reducing the bias introduced by methodology in pollen supplementation experiments and discuss our results in the context of optimality theory.},

Gender strategies control the relative contributions to fitness that result from maternal and parental investments. Cosexual, male and female morphs are distinguished by their average gender. A simple method for quantitatively estimating the functional gender of plants is used to distinguish three types of gender reactions to various circumstances, namely canalised, labile, and sequential gender responses.

Relative maternal and paternal expenditures. Maternal costs may exceed paternal costs by a considerable amount in many species.

Size-number compromises for seeds and pollen. The conflicting advantages of size and number have been actively investigated for seeds but not for pollen grains.

Seed and pollen packaging — the relative numbers of polliniferous flowers and fruit. Hermaphroditism, andromonoecy, and gynomonoecy are compared as relative packaging strategies.

The temporal control of maternal investment. Many factors influence the extent to which it is advantageous to control fruit numbers at the successive stages of flower determination, ovary development, and fruit maturation.

Breeding patterns control the parentage of seeds, and include the frequencies and distributions of sexual versus asexual reproduction and of self- versus cross-fertilisation. Botanists have concentrated on selection for genetic recombination as a factor controlling breeding patterns, and other factors have been under-emphasised.},

  abstract  = {Pollination commonly limits seed production, as addition of pollen to stigmas often increases fecundity. This response is usually interpreted as evidence that plants' stigmas receive too few pollen grains to maximize ovule fertilization (quantity limitation); however, many genetic studies demonstrate that poor-quality pollen can also reduce seed production (quality limitation). We explore both aspects of pollen limitation theoretically with a dose–response model that incorporates a saturating negative-exponential relation of seed production to pollen receipt. This relation depends on aspects of ovule production, pollen import, pollen–pistil interactions and seed development, all of which can contribute to pollen limitation. Our model reveals that quantity limitation is restricted to the lowest range of pollen receipt, for which siring success per pollen grain is high, whereas quality limitation acts throughout the range of pollen receipt if plants do not import the highest-quality pollen. In addition to pollinator availability and efficiency, quantity limitation is governed by all post-pollination aspects of seed production. In contrast, quality limitation depends on the difference in survival of embryos sired by naturally delivered pollen vs. by pollen of maximal quality. We briefly illustrate the distinction between these two components of pollen limitation with results from the mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus. Our model also shows that the standard pollen-supplementation technique neither estimates the total intensity of pollen limitation nor distinguishes between its quantity and quality components. As an alternative, we propose a methodological protocol that requires both measurement of seed production following excess pollination with only outcross pollen and quantification of the dose–response relation of seed output to pollen receipt. This method estimates both the total extent of pollen limitation and its two components. Finally, we consider the influences on quantity and quality limitation, which reveals that quantity limitation probably occurs much less often than has been inferred from pollen-supplementation experiments. These interpretations suggest that an expanded perspective that recognizes the fecundity consequences of pollination with poor-quality pollen would promote ecological understanding of pollen limitation.},

An initial “excess” of flowers, although making no numerical contribution to fruit set, may indirectly increase female reproductive success by allowing selective maturation of fruits of superior quality. I use a framework based on order statistics to assess the potential fitness benefit from this “wider choice” mechanism. The analysis shows that a floral surplus with subsequent selective abortion can generate large increases in mean female fitness. However, marginal fitness returns always diminished as the floral surplus increased (i.e., the fitness gain curve was always saturating), and imperfect selectivity of abortion could severely mute the advantages of surplus flowers. If the mating environment creates low variance in quality among developing fruits, then little benefit is derived from surplus flowers, while a high variance allows large fitness gains but with rapidly saturating benefits. The results imply that selection on flower number due to wider choice could be very strong in some circumstances, but that selection through this mechanism may often favor only a modest number of excess flowers.},

  abstract  = {The recent trend to place monetary values on ecosystem services has led to studies on the economic importance of pollinators for agricultural crops. Several recent studies indicate regional, long-term pollinator declines, and economic consequences have been derived from declining pollination efficiencies. However, use of pollinator services as economic incentives for conservation must consider environmental factors such as drought, pests, and diseases, which can also limit yields. Moreover, “flower excess” is a well-known reproductive strategy of plants as insurance against unpredictable, external factors that limit reproduction. With three case studies on the importance of pollination levels for amounts of harvested fruits of three tropical crops (passion fruit in Brazil, coffee in Ecuador, and cacao in Indonesia) we illustrate how reproductive strategies and environmental stress can obscure initial benefits from improved pollination. By interpreting these results with findings from evolutionary sciences, agronomy, and studies on wild-plant populations, we argue that studies on economic benefits from pollinators should include the total of ecosystem processes that (1) lead to successful pollination and (2) mobilize nutrients and improve plant quality to the extent that crop yields indeed benefit from enhanced pollinator services. Conservation incentives that use quantifications of nature's services to human welfare will benefit from approaches at the ecosystem level that take into account the broad spectrum of biological processes that limit or deliver the service.},

The attributable net income method improves upon previous methods in three ways: (1) it subtracts the cost of inputs to crop production from the value of pollination, thereby not attributing the value of these inputs to pollinators; (2) it values only the pollination that would be utilized by the crop plant for fruit production, thereby not valuing pollen deposited in excess of the plants’ requirements; and (3) it can attribute value separately to different pollinator taxa, for example to native vs. managed pollinators. We demonstrate all three methods using a data set on watermelon pollination by native bees and honey bees in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA. We discuss the reasons why different methods produce disparate values, and why the attributable net income method most accurately reflects the actual ecosystem service that is being valued, marketable fruit production.},

  abstract  = {1. There are two types of contamination of seed crops, mechanical admixture of seed and cross-pollination. The latter is the more difficult to eradicate. There are four main variables affecting cross-pollination between varieties: (i) the breeding system of the species; (ii) isolation distance; (iii) varietal mass; (iv) pollinating agent. Of these (iii) and (iv) have been most neglected. There is little work available entailing a systematic study of these four factors. There is, therefore, a need for such a study of the independent effect-s of these factors and their interactions. 
2. Using two insect-pollinated self-compatible species, radish and turnip, and suitable amounts of plants of the contaminating and contaminated varieties, the effect of distance on isolation is similar over a range of from 0 to 160 ft. At first there is a rapid reduction in contamination with increasing distance, but there is a progressive reduction in the decreases in contamination produced by repeated increases in isolation distance. In the experiment most conducive to contamination this fell from 60 % at 20 ft. to 13 % at 80 ft., but at 140 ft. it was still 6 %. In this same experiment, involving greater isolation distances than the others, on increasing the isolation distance from 160 to 580 ft. there was no evidence of a further decrease in contamination, which remained in the neighbourhood of 1%. As there are a priori reasons for expecting some decrease it must be presumed to be too slight for detection. 
3. The mass of a variety (here altered by varying the number of rows from 1 to 12), and the spatial arrangement of the plants, are as important in their effects on contamination as isolation distance. Mass is also similar to isolation distance in its mode of action, in that constant increases in the number of plants of a variety growing together produce progressively smaller decreases in its contamination. 
4. When pollinating insects are free to distribute themselves over a crop they do so in such a way that density of planting has no effect on the rate of decrease of contamination with increasing isolation distance.},

  abstract  = {Beetand maize were used for a study of the influence of distance in reducing cross-pollination, i.e. in effecting isolation in wind-pollinated crops, under conditions conducive to cross-pollination. In beet, Carter's strain of Spinach Beet was exposed to contamination from red beet of the variety Crimson Ball. The maximum contamination (at distance zero) was low (10 per cent.) because of therelatively small inflorescences of the red beet. With increasing distance, contamination rapidly declined. At 30 feet it was 1 per cent. of the maximum. 
In maize, Canada Gold (sweet corn) was contaminated by EarlyYellow Flint, contamination being discernible on the ripe ear. The results were similar but there was a distinct variation in contamination with direction from the contaminant, variation attributable to the wind direction being mainly south-west. One per cent. contamination was observed at 50 feet in the northern direction and 40 feet in the southern direction. 
In both crops the rate of decrease in contamination steadilydecreased with increasing isolation distance.
A high error variance between plants of Canada Gold was found to be due to variation in their silking time (female flowering). Late-silking plants missed the main flowering period of the contaminant variety, and therefore had less contamination than earlier plants atsimilar distances.
In the following year the use of glycerined slides to trap pollen grains around a maize plot produced evidence completely corroborating the previous contamination results. Here the time factor was eliminated from error variation. A distance of 60 feet was sufficient to reduce atmospheric pollen to 1 per cent. of the concentration obtaining within the plot.
The results of other workers on pollen dispersal in herbage grasses and beet, after due allowance has been made for a greater buoyancy of pollen in these crops, agree with the present maize results. One may conclude that the requirements in respect of isolation distance of wind-pollinated and insect-pollinated crops are similar. The greater buoyancy of the pollen of some wind-pollinated crops could be allowed for by increasing the size of plots liable to contamination.},

1. Insects move independently of one another, but the experiments show that they do so in a statistically predictable manner. Air, on the other hand, moves in large masses broken up by turbulence, the effects of which are also predictable; but the movement is modified by variation in wind direction and velocity which is unpredictable.
2. Insects carry pollen systematically from flower to flower of the same species under normal wind conditions, if the species is evenly dispersed, the pollen is distributed equally in all directions. Air-borne pollen, on the other hand, is distributed down-wind and alights on a stigma without regard to its species.
3. An insect can carry only a limited amount of pollen available for pollination. Consequently the amount of pollen of one variety on an insect can increase only at the expense of other varieties. In the air, on the other hand, the amount is almost unlimited. The atmospheric concentration of pollen of one variety, therefore, has no direct influence on the concentration of another. Bearing in mind these distinctions, formula are derived for theeffect of distance on contamination in insect- and wind-pollinated crops. These agree well with the experimental results now described. The formula for the two classes of pollination are unexpectedly similar; so similar indeed that one can derive a common formula for the two. With this formula one can use the contamination observed at two distances to predict what will be found at a third. The formula also throws some light on the breeding behaviour of natural populations.},

When processed, this oil has been observed to be less stable than oil (typically containing 5 to 25 ppm chlorophyll) processed from high-grade seed.

The effect of initial pheophytin content was examined by mixing fully saturated oil (tricapryloylglycerol) with increasing amounts of pheophytin and then by subjecting the mixtures to processing conditions. When the processed oils were combined with an unsaturated oil (canola oil), the oxidative stabilities decreased as the pre-processing content of pheophytin increased. Examination of the effect of increased bleaching to remove excessive levels of pheophytin showed that oil stability decreased with increasing exposure to bleaching clay. Additionally, processing treatments did not remove secondary autoxidation products from oil that was abused prior to processing. Such a finding revealed the importance of initial oil quality on processed oil stability, i.e., the greater abuse of the crude oil (resulting in greater contents of secondary oxidation products), the lower the stability of the processed oil. Finally, previous reports by other researchers of pheophytin's pro-oxidative effect in oil stored in light were confirmed.},

During the last decades, the demand for vegetable oils as food, non-food, and biofuel has grown significantly. This demand could be satisfied due to improved agronomic developments, better processing methods, and improvements in the varieties available. The yield however varies in different countries, reflecting different input levels and production efficiency. This highlights the room for crop improvement, and the yield will continue to be the primary focus of many rapeseed improvement programs. Besides yield and yield stability increasing seed oil content and further improvement of oil and meal qualities have become one of the most important breeding criteria. Modern varieties are based on a relatively small subset of the available genetic diversities. Rapeseed is thus likely to respond strongly to programs aimed at selectively enhancing genetic variation for key economic input and output traits.

Background and Aims
Timing of reproduction is a key life-history trait that is regulated by resource availability. Delayed reproduction in soils with low phosphorus availability is common among annuals, in contrast to the accelerated reproduction typical of other low-nutrient environments. It is hypothesized that this anomalous response arises from the high marginal value of additional allocation to root growth caused by the low mobility of phosphorus in soils.
Methods

To better understand the benefits and costs of such delayed reproduction, a two-resource dynamic allocation model of plant growth and reproduction is presented. The model incorporates growth, respiration, and carbon and phosphorus acquisition of both root and shoot tissue, and considers the reallocation of resources from senescent leaves. The model is parameterized with data from Arabidopsis and the optimal reproductive phenology is explored in a range of environments.
Key Results

The model predicts delayed reproduction in low-phosphorus environments. Reproductive timing in low-phosphorus environments is quite sensitive to phosphorus mobility, but is less sensitive to the temporal distribution of mortality risks. In low-phosphorus environments, the relative metabolic cost of roots was greater, and reproductive allocation reduced, compared with high-phosphorus conditions. The model suggests that delayed reproduction in response to low phosphorus availability may be reduced in plants adapted to environments where phosphorus mobility is greater.
Conclusions

Delayed reproduction in low-phosphorus soils can be a beneficial response allowing for increased acquisition and utilization of phosphorus. This finding has implications both for efforts to breed crops for low-phosphorus soils, and for efforts to understand how climate change may impact plant growth and productivity in low-phosphorus environments.},

This idea, pioneered by Dan Cohen, has been formalized as an optimal control problem and analysed using Pontryagin’s maximum principle or dynamic programming. Here, I review several examples of dynamic resource allocation models. First, the seasonal timing of reproduction of annuals is discussed. This can be extended to plants with multiple vegetative organs and the optimal shoot–root balance is assessed. Secondly, the growth schedule over multiple seasons is examined, and the reproductive effort, the leaf phenology of deciduous perennials, and the conditions under which perenniality is more advantageous than annuality are considered. With some modifications, the same model can handle intermittent reproduction and monocarpic perennials (one large reproduction after many years). Thirdly, growth in an unpredictably fluctuating environment is analysed for the case in which a sudden disturbance (herbivory or fire) removes the photosynthetic system altogether, followed by recovery using stored material, and for the case in which environmental productivity fluctuates in a Markovian process. Finally, the optimal level of chemical defence against herbivory is formalized and used to explain the intensity of alkaloid defence decreasing with leaf age. These examples illustrate the usefulness of dynamic resource allocation models in understanding plant life-history adaptation.},

The most important bee-pollinated plants yielding unifloral honeys are: black locust/robinia (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), lime (Tilia spp.), rape (Brassica napus L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.), goldenrod (Solidago canadensis L.), milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.) and wild garlic (Allium ursinum L.). Robinia and milkweed honeys belong to the speciality honeys, so-called “Hungaricums”, while robinia and sunflower honey are popular export products of Hungary. Among the rare unifloral honey sources the nectar of Brassica, Fagopyrum, Melilotus, Phacelia and Trifolium species can be mentioned. Other nectar-producing plants of the Hungarian flora contribute to multifloral honeys, which are also popular with consumers. The nectar of early blooming fruit trees is important for honeybees in the brood rearing season, but rarely can provide unifloral honey, as well. The quantity and quality of the available nectar sources can show huge differences depending on the season, environmental conditions, the blooming stage of the plant, the age of the flowers and the time of the day.},

  abstract  = {Mechanistic approaches to community ecology are those which employ individual— ecological concepts—those of behavioral ecology, physiological ecology, and ecomorphology— as theoretical bases for understanding community patterns. Such approaches, which began explicitly about a decade ago, are just now coming into prominence. They stand in contrast to more traditional approaches, such as MacArthur and Levins (1967),which interpret community ecology almost strictly in terms of “megaparameters.”.

Mechanistic approaches can be divided into those which use population dynamics as a major component of the theory and those which do not; examples of the two are about equally common. The first approach sacrifices a highly detailed representation of individual— ecological processes; the second sacrifices an explicit representation of the abundance and persistence of populations.

Three subdisciplines of ecology—individual, population and community ecology—form a “perfect” hierarchy in Beckner's (1974) sense. Two other subdisciplines—ecosystem ecology and evolutionary ecology—lie somewhat laterally to this hierarchy. The modelling of community phenomena using sets of population-dynamical equations is argued as an attempt at explanation via the reduction of community to population ecology. Much of the debate involving Florida State ecologists is over whether or not such a relationship is additive (or conjunctive), a very strong form of reduction. I argue that reduction of community to individual ecology is plausible via a reduction of population ecology to individual ecology. Approaches that derive the population-dynamical equations used in population and community ecology from individual-ecological considerations, and which provide a decomposition of megaparameters into behavioral and physiological parameters, are cited as illustrating how the reduction might be done. I argue that “sufficient parameters” generally will not enhance theoretical understanding in community ecology.

A major advantage of the mechanistic approach is that variation in population and community patterns can be understood as variation in individual-ecological conditions. In addition to enriching the theory, this allows the best functional form to be chosen for modeling higher-level phenomena, where “best” is defined as biologically most appropriate rather than mathematically most convenient. Disadvantages of the mechanistic approach are that it may portend an overly complex, massive and special theory, and that it naturally tends to avoid many-species phenomena such as indirect effects. The paper ends with a scenario for a mechanistic-ecological utopia.},

  abstract  = {Insects contribute to the pollination of about 75% of crop species. Among such insect-pollinated crops, oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is increasingly cultivated worldwide. However, the degree to which seed set in B. napus depends on insect pollination is still under debate. To compare research approaches for estimating pollinator dependency, we reviewed the relevant literature published between 1956 and 2018. The majority of the studies were conducted in Europe (75%) on winter cultivars (77%) and monitored honeybees (52%). Our main findings are: (1) Dependency on insect pollination differs among cultivars and regions. (2) Field observations provide more realistic and comparable results than observations on caged plants. (3) Field conditions, soil nutrient availability, and pest management practices all influence insect dependency and subsequent yield. (4) Plot size conditions pollinator behaviour, as pollination success can be related to insect density or diversity depending on the size of the plot. (5) Insect numbers vary according to the observation distances within a field. (6) Comparison between studies is complicated by the use of different proxies to assess final yield, which may not be equivalent. We provide several recommendations to improve the reliability of future studies of oilseed rape pollination and of insect pollination dependency such as choosing open field observations compared to bag, cage or greenhouse studies, registering field conditions (pests, pesticides, fertilisation level) and defining yield as total seeds per plant to take into consideration compensation mechanisms.},

  abstract  = {We studied the reproductive ecology of Clintonia borealis, a clonal understory species, in eastern Ontario. Flowers are protogynous and require insect pollination for outcrossing and maximum seed set. Most pollination is done by nectar-gathering bumble bees. We recorded pollen deposition and flowering patterns in 1983. Flowering lasted for about 10 days in mid-June. Stigmatic pollen loads were lowest at the onset of blooming, reflecting the scarcity of male-phase flowers. Pollination increased significantly by peak bloom and subsequently remained high. However, since bees fly mostly between neighboring stems, much of the pollen transferred may have been geitonogamous. In 1983, seed set per flower was not increased by supplementing pollination or by reducing the number of fruits competing for resources per stem. Rather, flowers set more seeds (14%) only if both treatments were performed simultaneously. Seed size was increased by 25% when competitive fruits were removed and by 5% more when pollen was added under the removal treatment. Further work in 1984 showed that pollination effects may be related to changes in pollen source. Selfed flowers set fewer and smaller seeds than outcrossed ones when screened from insects and hand pollinated. Outcrossing distance had little effect on seed set or seed size. Thus, in C. borealis seed number and seed size are limited by a balance between maternal resource availability and the amount of outcrossing provided by pollinators.},

  abstract  = {The effect of pollen addition and reduction on the fruit and seed production of ground cherry (Physalis longifolia) plants was examined experimentally in the field over an entire flowering season. Pollen levels were manipulated for entire plants by augmenting natural pollination with hand-pollinations and reducing natural pollination by taping half of the flowers closed. These manipulations make it possible to determine if plants are simultaneously resource and pollen limited, a condition that suggests the plant is maximizing seed production given the resources available for female reproduction. Effects of pollen manipulation were dependent on the size of the plant. Large plants responded to reduced pollination by increasing flower produc- tion and the number of seeds per fruit; as a result, total seed production did not differ from that of large control plants. In contrast, small plants showed no change in response to reduced pollination, yet seed production did not differ significantly from that of controls, as seed produc- tion in both groups was low. Large hand-pollinated plants did not differ significantly from large control plants in any components of yield. In contrast, small hand-pollinated plants had significantly higher percentage fruit set and produced significantly more fruit and seeds than did small control plants. Differences in seed production reflected different proportions of plants that set some rather than no fruit. This may result from low pollinator visitation rates to small plants with small floral displays. Experimental results for large plants are only consistent with the hypothesis that large plants are simultaneously resource and pollen limited. To the extent that there is a trade-off between flower production and seed provisioning, large P. Iongifolia plants are allocating resources so as to maximize maternal seed production. In contrast, small plants are only pollen limited},

One such tool that has gained significant traction in the biological sciences is structural equation models (SEM), a form of path analysis that resolves complex multivariate relationships among a suite of interrelated variables.
2. Evaluation of SEMs has historically relied on covariances among variables, rather than the values of the data points themselves. While this approach permits a wide variety of model forms, it limits the incorporation of detailed specifications. Recent developments have allowed for the simultaneous implementation of non-normal distributions, random effects and different correlation structures using local estimation, but this process is not yet automated and consequently, evaluation can be prohibitive with complex models.
3. Here, I present a fully documented, open-source package piecewiseSEM, a practical implementation of confirmatory path analysis for the r programming language. The package extends this method to all current (generalized) linear, (phylogenetic) least-square, and mixed effects models, relying on familiar r syntax. I also provide two worked examples: one involving random effects and temporal autocorrelation, and a second involving phylogenetically independent contrasts.
4. My goal is to provide a user-friendly and tractable implementation of SEM that also reflects the ecological and methodological processes generating data.},

  abstract  = {Background. Up to 75% of crop species benefit at least to some degree from animal pollination for fruit or seed set and yield. However, basic information on the level of pollinator dependence and pollinator contribution to yield is lacking for many crops. Even less is known about how insect pollination affects crop quality. Given that habitat loss and agricultural intensification are known to decrease pollinator richness and abundance, there is a need to assess the consequences for different components of crop production.
Methods. We used pollination exclusion on flowers or inflorescences on a whole plant basis to assess the contribution of insect pollination to crop yield and quality in four flowering crops (spring oilseed rape, field bean, strawberry, and buckwheat) located in four regions of Europe. For each crop, we recorded abundance and species richness of flower visiting insects in ten fields located along a gradient from simple to heterogeneous landscapes.
Results. Insect pollination enhanced average crop yield between 18 and 71% depending on the crop. Yield quality was also enhanced in most crops. For instance, oilseed rape had higher oil and lower chlorophyll contents when adequately pollinated, the proportion of empty seeds decreased in buckwheat, and strawberries’ commercial grade improved; however, we did not find higher nitrogen content in open pollinated field beans. Complex landscapes had a higher overall species richness of wild pollinators across crops, but visitation rates were only higher in complex landscapes for some crops. On the contrary, the overall yield was consistently enhanced by higher visitation rates, but not by higher pollinator richness.
Discussion. For the four crops in this study, there is clear benefit delivered by pollinators on yield quantity and/or quality, but it is not maximized under current agricultural intensification. Honeybees, the most abundant pollinator, might partially compensate the loss of wild pollinators in some areas, but our results suggest the need of landscape-scale actions to enhance wild pollinator populations.},

Reduced gene flow is expected to minimize the impact of genetically engineered (GE) crops on feral and natural populations and to facilitate the coexistence of different agricultural markets. The goal of this study is to link foraging behavior to gene flow and identify behaviors that can help predict gene flow for different bee species. To reach this goal, we first examined and compared the foraging behaviors of three distinct bee species, the European honey bee, Apis mellifera L., the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens Cr., and the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata F., foraging on Medicago sativa flowers. Each foraging behavior investigated differed among bee species. Both social bees exhibited directionality of movement and had similar residence, in contrast to the random movement and shorter residence of the solitary bee. Tripping rate and net distance traveled differed among the three bee species. We ranked each behavior among bee species and used the relative ranking as gene flow predictor before testing the predictions against empirical gene flow data. Tripping rate and net distance traveled, but not residence, predicted relative gene dispersal among bee species. Linking specific behaviors to gene flow provides mechanisms to explain differences in gene flow among bee species and guides the development of management practices to reduce gene flow. Although developed in one system, the approach developed here can be generalized to different plant/pollinator systems.},

  abstract  = {Background: If the amount of resources allocated to reproduction (K) is fixed, then an increase in seed mass (S) can only be achieved by a decrease in seed number (n = K/S). Thus, log(n) = log(K)-log(S) producing a slope of -1 when seed mass and number are plotted on log-log axes. However, in comparative studies, empirical support for a slope of -1 is limited and contentious, leading some to question the utility of this concept.
Methodology/Principal Findings: First, we show that the expected slope depends on whether genotypes and species producing seeds of different mass are expected to reach the same adult size and that this in turn depends partly on the nature of growth. Second, we present experimental results using a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana. When these RILs are grown in large pots with plentiful nutrients, they exhibit a trade-off between seed size and number with a slope of -1.68 (±0.18) on log-log axes. This occurs because of genetic correlations between seed mass and adult size so that, under the right growth conditions, lines producing lighter seeds have the genetic potential to produce larger rosettes and hence a greater total mass of seeds. We re-grew lines in small pots (10 and 40 mm diameter) in a nutrient-poor substrate so that final adult size was heavily restricted by pot size.
Conclusions/Significance: Under our growth conditions, small-seeded lines were unable to produce a greater total mass of seeds. Hence a trade-off emerged between seed mass and seed number with a slope of -1.166±0.319 on log-log axes in 40-mm diameter pots (close to the expected value of -1), although the slope was 0.132±0.263 in 10-mm diameter pots, demonstrating that the nature of the trade-off is sensitive to the growth conditions.},

  abstract  = {Whereas the concept that availability of resources drives seed production is sound in principle, it is incomplete as there are many solutions to the allocation of resources that derive from the trade-off between number and size. This paper examines evolutionary aspects of this trade-off in annual grain crops. The analysis is centred on the working hypotheses that, for a given species and environment, allocation of resources to reproduction involves (H1) high plasticity in seed number, which allows for variable resource availability, and (H2) a relatively narrow range of seed size that results from evolutionary and agronomic selection. Comparisons between crops and fish are used to highlight common evolutionary elements in taxa where parents provide little or no care to their offspring, with the consequence that both number and early survival of offspring, hence fitness of parents, are partially related to embryo size and reserves.

The plasticity of seed number in relation to availability of resources is analysed against the established relationship between offspring number and parent growth rate during critical stages. The notion that seed size is under stabilising selection is analysed against three conditions: (1) mean seed size is conservative for a given species and environment, (2) seed size affects fitness, and (3) seed size is heritable. Databases from published papers were compiled to analyse the relative variability of seed size and number, and the heritability of seed size. Evidence for and against the link between seed size and parental fitness is revised using the Smith–Fretwell model as framework (Am. Nat., 108, 499–506).

The proposal of high plasticity of seed number and narrow variability of seed size resulting from stabilising natural selection is generally consistent with evolutionary and genetic considerations. Agronomic selection may have reinforced natural selection leading to relatively narrow seed size in species such as wheat and soybean, where cultivated types retained high plasticity for seed number. In contrast, selection for one or few inflorescences in crops like sunflower and maize may have morphologically reduced seed number plasticity and increased variability of seed size and its responsiveness to resource availability in relation to their wild ancestors.},

Under competitive conditions, the weight of sown seeds is positively correlated phenotypically with final plant stature, lifetime flower production, lifetime fruit production, and seed production. To establish the evolutionary significance of seed-weight variation in a natural population, I conducted reciprocal crosses among individuals chosen from a wild population in Connecticut. The progeny were sown in an experimental garden, and an analysis of 12 life history and fitness components was conducted on the paternal half sibs. This design provided estimates of the narrow-sense and broad-sense heritabilities of the weight of sown seeds (produced by the parental generation), germination and flowering dates, 7 fitness components, the weight of seeds produced by F$_1$ adults, and lifetime maternal fecundity. The results suggest that natural selection could not operate to effect evolutionary change in seed weight in this experimental population. Maternal environmental effects, non-additive genetic effects, and/or developmental sources of variation are largely responsible for the phenotypic variance in seed weight in wild radish. Additive genetic variance was detected in several life history and fitness components, suggesting that additive genetic variance in total fitness exists within this population.},

For most species, within-plant variation was the larger component of total variance, averaging 62% of total variance. Variation in seed mass among fruits within crops was significant in most species tested.

We conclude that variation in seed mass among and within plants is widespread and common. There was little evidence of trade-offs between number of seeds and mean or variance of seed mass, and little correlational evidence of local competition for maternal resources. No consistent ecological (dispersal mode and growth form) correlates of variance of seed mass were evident.},

  abstract  = {Aggregated nesting is widespread among the solitary Hymenoptera and may represent an important step toward the evolution of eusociality via the semisocial pathway. Five hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of nesting aggregations: first, aggregation may occur in response to restricted distribution of some key resource; second, aggregation may increase foraging efficiency; third, aggregation may confer improved protection from natural enemies; fourth, aggregation may decrease the cost of nest site search; and fifth, aggregation may increase opportunities to reuse old nests. Proximate explanations for the formation of nesting aggregations, including the philopatry hypothesis, do not compete with these ultimate explanations but, rather, complement them. The role of parasitoid pressure in favouring or disfavouring aggregated nesting has become an area of active research and debate. In this paper, the author reviews field studies of density-dependent foraging by nest parasitoids and resulting patterns of nest exploitation to test generalizations concerning the effects of parasitoids. Nest parasitoids foraged either independently of host nest density or they concentrated in areas of high nest density. Nest parasitism was directly density-dependent, density-independent or inversely density-dependent. Thus, parasitoid pressure may favour either aggregated or dispersed nesting. Diversity in patterns of density-dependence appears to result from the interaction of variable parasitoid foraging strategies and host defensive strategies. Inversely density-dependent parasitism may result from parasitoids being limited by egg supply or handling time, or from improved defence capabilities of grouped hosts. Improved defence may be a product of increased parasitoid confusion, active group defence, selfish herding, or improved parasitoid detection. Data supporting these hypotheses are critically reviewed and further research needs are identified.},

It examines: (1) colony-level effects of energy manipulation, to see if shifts in a colony's energy requirements produce shifts in the behaviour of its workers; and (2) the behaviour of individuals who changed tasks following manipulation and those that did not, to see if task specialization, based on learning, can explain differences between these groups. Individually marked bumblebees were observed at three colonies of each of three species (Bombus flavifrons, B. melanopygus, and B. occidentalis). Overall, colonies responded to changes in their energy stores, both by adjusting the relative sizes of the foraging and within-nest work-force, and by changing the behaviour of individual foragers. In response to energy manipulations, colonies allocated effort where demand was relatively greatest (foraging versus within-nest tasks), collected more of the resource that was in greater immediate demand (nectar versus pollen), and changed the rate at which each forager collected food (within-nest bout durations). Task switching behaviour was generally consistent with that expected by learning-constrained task specialization: (1) less efficient foragers switched to withinnest tasks when energy stores were enhanced; (2) workers who began foraging after energy depletion were less efficient than were continuing foragers and (3) workers who switched from pollen to nectar collection following energy depletion were less efficient foragers both before and after the manipulation. However, workers who switched from nectar to pollen collection were no less efficient at their old or new tasks than non-switching bees. In general, worker bumblebees show a flexible division of labour in the face of short-term changes in their colony's energy state.},

These plant resources are also exploited by a recent alien pest now established in southern Alberta, Canada: the cabbage seedpod weevil, Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). A caged study was conducted with Brassica napus L. in 2000 and 2002 to determine if various combinations and densities of lygus and seedpod weevils (0, 10 + 10, 20 of either, 20 + 20, 40 + 40, individuals per cage) affected yield and its components such as number of branches, pods and seed weight. Under severely dry conditions, cages with the intermediate (20 + 20) and high (40 + 40) insect combinations had lower grain yield as well as number of racemes and pods per raceme relative to control cages with no insects added. Under more humid conditions in 2002, similar results were observed but the damage by the cabbage seedpod weevil at 20 adults per cage was more apparent than in 2000. These results suggest that in most years the weevil is a more serious pest than lygus bugs but low combined densities do not decrease yield. Furthermore, in southern Alberta at low or moderate densities, these late-season pests do not appear to stimulate plants to overcompensate. There was no indication of competition between these two insects.},

The number of generations and synchrony of Lygus adults and nymphs with canola varies across the growing regions of the Canadian prairies. The economic threshold for Lygus in conventional canola is well established for southern Manitoba. Other areas of the prairies, particularly the northern growing regions, have inherently different growing conditions that are likely to lead to different economic injury levels. This, combined with the advent and widespread adoption of new hybrid canola varieties, suggests that this unpredictable pest deserves new research efforts designed to examine the relationship between Lygus and current canola production systems. Further, a closer investigation of the natural enemies and unique growing conditions that contribute to the “unpredictable” nature of Lygus outbreaks in canola is needed.},

Network theory offers important tools for understanding how groups of flowering plants and insects interact. However, most studies of plant–pollinator networks aggregate samples over time, masking phenological changes in the network over the growing season. Furthermore, estimates of biodiversity are derived from network observations, meaning that the ecological community is not assessed independently from the structure of the network. Understanding how biodiversity influences network structure over time is important for predicting how global change will affect the ecological processes shaping networks. In this study, we sampled the flower community, insect community, and the pollination network of a high Arctic dwarf-shrub ecosystem over the course of an entire growing season. We found that the flower community was a stronger predictor of network complexity and interaction diversity than the insect community. We suggest that studying networks at scales relevant to both plants and pollinators can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying network formation. This improved knowledge could help to better understand and predict the ongoing phenological changes in Arctic and alpine ecosystems.},

  abstract  = {Pressure to increase food production to meet the demands of a growing human population can make conservation-motivated recommendations to limit agricultural expansion impractical. Therefore, we need to identify conservation actions that can support biodiversity without taking land out of production. Previous studies suggest this can be accomplished by increasing “farmland heterogeneity”—i.e. heterogeneity of the cropped portions of agricultural landscapes—by, for example, decreasing field sizes. However, it is not yet clear whether policies/guidelines that promote farmland heterogeneity will be as effective as those targeting farming practices. Here, we estimated the relative effects of six practices—annual/perennial crop, fertilizer use, herbicide use, insecticide use, tile drainage, and tillage—versus two aspects of farmland heterogeneity—field size and crop diversity—on the diversity of herbaceous plants, woody plants, butterflies, syrphid flies, bees, carabid beetles, spiders, and birds in rural eastern Ontario, Canada. The strength of effect of farming practices and farmland heterogeneity varied among taxonomic groups. Nevertheless, we found important effects of both farming practices and farmland heterogeneity on the combined (multi) diversity across these groups. In particular, we found greater multidiversity in untilled, perennial crop fields than tilled, annual crop fields, and greater multidiversity in agricultural landscapes with smaller crop fields and less diverse crops. The directions of effect of these variables were generally consistent across individual taxonomic groups. For example, richness was lower in landscapes with larger fields and more diverse crops than in landscapes with smaller fields and less diverse crops for all taxa except spiders. The negative effect of crop diversity on multidiversity and the richness of most of the studied taxa indicates that this aspect of farmland heterogeneity does not necessarily benefit wildlife species. Nevertheless, a compelling implication of this study is that it suggests that policies/guidelines aimed at reducing crop field sizes would be at least as effective for conservation of biodiversity within working agricultural landscapes as those designed to promote a wildlife-friendly farming practice.},

The impact of epigeal and flying aphid predators, in isolation and together, on cereal aphids was tested in five fields with standard field margins (ca. 2 m wide) and in five fields with wide margins (ca. 6 m wide). Flying predators alone were as effective as all predators in controlling the grain aphid and reduced aphids by 90% and 93%, whereas epigeal predators alone achieved a reduction of only 40% and 18% in fields with standard and wide margins respectively. Levels of parasitism measured by counts of aphid mummies were relatively low (<=12%) on all sampling occasions. There was no evidence that the wide field margins increased natural enemies within the adjacent field as measured using pitfall traps, suction sampling and sticky traps. The wide field margins were considered to have no benefit for biocontrol because flying predators capable of moving between fields were primarily responsible or the amount of uncropped land suitable for natural enemies was not a limiting factor in the landscape.},

  abstract  = {One potentially important ecosystem service in agricultural fields is the regulation of weeds by carabid beetles, but the effect of agricultural management on the level of regulation has so far been poorly documented. In this study, we monitored weed seed predation rates of Viola arvensis and Capsella bursa-pastoris and carabids from March to September using a grid sampling in two adjacent winter-wheat fields, one in conventional tillage (T) and the other converted to direct drilling with cover-crop for five years (DD). At the field level, weed seed predation was positively correlated to the activity of granivores in the tilled field and was marginally higher in DD than in T during wheat growth. After harvest, granivores and predation rates declined sharply in the cover crop of the DD system whereas they increased in the bare tilled field. This result suggests that the dense cover crop set up after harvest was not suitable for the local pool of autumn-breeding granivores. Spatial aggregations of carabid and predation variables were detected using the MAPCOMP software; these spatial patterns differed between the two management systems and were temporally unstable but consistent over large intervals of spatial resolutions. There were significant spatial associations between trophic guilds and predation rates, i.e. predation rates were positively or negatively associated either to granivores or to omnivores, depending on the time and on the management system. These results highlight the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the level of interactions taking place during a crop cycle, a complexity which explains the important variability in the delivery of ecosystem services such as weed seed predation.},

We addressed this knowledge gap through a novel application of the modified Price equation to evaluate responses of bees to diverse floral communities on 36 farms in Washington, USA, over 3 years. We found that floral richness, not floral identity, was the best predictor of floral visits by bees. However, the benefits of regionally rare floral species (i.e. plants found at relatively few sites) were only fully realised when farms were embedded in diverse landscapes. Our analysis used the modified Price equation to demonstrate that plant diversity, rather than specific plant species, promotes pollinator visitation, and that diverse landscapes promote the response of pollinators to regionally rare plant species.},

  abstract  = {Creating institutions to meet the challenge of sustainability is arguably the most important task confronting society; it is also dauntingly complex. Ecological, economic, and social elements all play a role, but despite ongoing efforts, researchers have yet to succeed in integrating the various disciplines in a way that gives adequate representation to the insights of each.Panarchy, a term devised to describe evolving hierarchical systems with multiple interrelated elements, offers an important new framework for understanding and resolving this dilemma. Panarchy is the structure in which systems, including those of nature (e.g., forests) and of humans (e.g., capitalism), as well as combined human-natural systems (e.g., institutions that govern natural resource use such as the Forest Service), are interlinked in continual adaptive cycles of growth, accumulation, restructuring, and renewal. These transformational cycles take place at scales ranging from a drop of water to the biosphere, over periods from days to geologic epochs. By understanding these cycles and their scales, researchers can identify the points at which a system is capable of accepting positive change, and can use those leverage points to foster resilience and sustainability within the system.This volume brings together leading thinkers on the subject -- including Fikret Berkes, Buz Brock, Steve Carpenter, Carl Folke, Lance Gunderson, C.S. Holling, Don Ludwig, Karl-Goran Maler, Charles Perrings, Marten Scheffer, Brian Walker, and Frances Westley -- to develop and examine the concept of panarchy and to consider how it can be applied to human, natural, and human-natural systems. Throughout, contributors seek to identify adaptive approaches to management that recognize uncertainty and encourage innovation while fostering resilience.The book is a fundamental new development in a widely acclaimed line of inquiry. It represents the first step in integrating disciplinary knowledge for the adaptive management of human-natural systems across widely divergent scales, and offers an important base of knowledge from which institutions for adaptive management can be developed. It will be an invaluable source of ideas and understanding for students, researchers, and professionals involved with ecology, conservation biology, ecological economics, environmental policy, or related fields.},

Rewilding draws from the backloop, facilitating reorganization and the transition from alpha to r phases so that the system maintains resilience while adapting to changed conditions. If environmental conditions have changed so significantly that a regime shift is inevitable then managers could opt for passive rewilding and allow a novel ecosystem to develop on its own. Alternatively, they could opt for active rewilding of a novel ecosystem to sustain the provision of ecosystem services under projected environmental conditions.},

  abstract  = {An important goal of ecological compensation measures in agricultural areas is the conservation and enhancement of regional species diversity. However, some current European agri-environment schemes seem to be rather ineffective. A likely explanation is the lack of source populations in intensely cultivated landscapes. Remnants of natural and seminatural habitats can contribute to regional biodiversity in various ways: as essential habitats for specialised species, as stepping stones, and as temporary habitats for hibernation, larval development, or preovipository feeding.

The overall percentage of arthropod species, for which seminatural habitats are an essential prerequisite for living in an agricultural landscape, was assessed with a 5 km long transect of 18 standardised trapping stations. The transect extended from an isolated area of wetland through intensely managed crop fields and grassland to an isolated semiarid meadow bordered by mixed forest.

For more than 1000 arthropod species the spatial and temporal distribution of a one year's catch along the transect was interpreted with regard to their affinity to seminatural habitats. Experts were asked to judge questionable cases of apparent ubiquist species.

All in all, more than 63% of all animal species (except for soil and water fauna) living in the agriculturally managed areas of the Limpach valley seem to depend on the presence of seminatural habitats. We conclude that remnant islands of natural or seminatural habitats provide the most important source populations for agri-environment schemes in order to enhance biodiversity in an otherwise depleted agricultural landscape.},

(3) Does the density of predators overwintering in field margins determine their distribution and abundance in adjacent cereal fields in spring? The value of field margins to agriculture was assessed as the density of arthropods overwintering in these habitats. The arthropod groups used for the assessment were known aphid predators which moved out into cereal crops in the spring. This assessment was compared with general arthropod diversity at each site to test whether field margins supporting high densities of predators were also of value to nature conservation in supporting greater arthropod biodiversity. In spring, the spatial dynamics of predatory arthropod species were investigated in cereal crops adjacent to field-margin overwintering sites. The influence of field-margin habitats on natural enemy populations within adjacent crops was evaluated. The enhancement of natural enemies and general arthropod conservation are discussed as components of overall biological diversity at the farm scale.},

  abstract  = {Agricultural landscapes can be characterized as a mosaic of habitat patches interspersed with hostile matrix, or as a gradient of patches ranging from suitable to unsuitable for different species. Arthropods moving through these landscapes encounter a range of edges, with different permeability. Patches of native vegetation in these landscapes may support natural enemies of crop pests by providing alternate hosts for parasitic wasps and/or acting as a source for predatory insects. We test this by quantifying species interactions and measuring movement across different edge-types. A high diversity of parasitoid species used hosts in the native vegetation patches, however we recorded few instances of the same parasitoid species using hosts in both the native vegetation and the crop (canola). However, we did find overall greater densities of parasitoids moving from native vegetation into the crop. Of the parasitoid groups examined, parasitoids of aphids (Braconidae: Aphidiinae) frequently moved from native vegetation into canola. In contrast, parasitoids of caterpillars (Braconidae: Microgastrinae) moved commonly from cereal fields into canola. Late season samples showed both aphids and parasitoids moving frequently out of native vegetation, in contrast predators moved less commonly from native vegetation (across the whole season). The season-long net advantage or disadvantage of native vegetation for pest control services is therefore difficult to evaluate. It appears that the different edge-types alter movement patterns of natural enemies more so than herbivorous pest species, and this may impact pest control services.},

However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57% of studies used a stepwise procedure.
2. The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples.
3. We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set.
4. An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.},

The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study.

The latter enables us to fix a well known problem with AIC for such models, thereby improving the range of model selection tools available. The smooth functions are represented by reduced rank spline like smoothers, with associated quadratic penalties measuring function smoothness. Model estimation is by penalized likelihood maximization, where the smoothing parameters controlling the extent of penalization are estimated by Laplace approximate marginal likelihood. The methods cover, for example, generalized additive models for nonexponential family responses (e.g., beta, ordered categorical, scaled t distribution, negative binomial and Tweedie distributions), generalized additive models for location scale and shape (e.g., two stage zero inflation models, and Gaussian location-scale models), Cox proportional hazards models and multivariate additive models. The framework reduces the implementation of new model classes to the coding of some standard derivatives of the log-likelihood. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract  = {Increasing natural vegetation in agricultural landscapes can create habitat for beneficial organisms such as pollinators and the natural enemies of crop pests. Adding perennial vegetation can also support biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation objectives. However, implementing such changes to agricultural land use across large geographic areas will require a strategic approach. This study examined the amount and distribution of uncultivated areas in Canadian prairie croplands, focusing on Alberta’s agricultural zone (226,543 km2 ). The aim was to identify locations in this region that have potential for increasing non-crop land cover within fields. This assessment was based on a multi-scale model of landscape complexity that described the distribution of land cover as a function of the distance from field centers. It is based on the assumption that the land cover in the field neighborhood is an informative index of how much non-crop area might realistically be maintained or restored in the field itself; i.e., because neighboring lands will reflect the local environmental conditions that support the growth and establishment of non-crop vegetation as well as the likelihood that crop growers will remove areas from production. The model identified variation across the region in land cover distribution, with regions at latitudes between 52 N and 55 N demonstrating the greatest contrasts in the amount of non-crop land between the field and the field neighborhood scale. These findings suggest that there remains capacity for land use decision-makers to optimize the distribution of non-crop land covers in ways the reduce the differences between these scales (i.e., to increase non-crop covers within fields to better represent the neighborhood proportions). Modeling also revealed scale-dependent patterns, such as field margins without crops (400–500 m from field centers) broadly distributed across the region, and evidence that gradients in moisture and temperature have interacted with
land use decisions to shape the proximity of non-crop area to fields.},

  abstract = {In an agroecosystem, catches of epigeal invertebrate predators obtained by pitfall traps were compared to absolute population densities estimated by ground photoeclectors in two different habitats, a field and an adjacent set-aside land. In general, abundance of Carabidae and Lycosidae were overestimated by pitfalls, while Staphylinidae and Linyphiidae were underestimated, and beetle larvae showed no obvious trend. The overestimation of Carabidae and Lycosidae by pitfalls had its maximum in spring and summer. Numbers collected by pitfalls did represent actual population densities better in the field than in the set-aside. This is probably caused by the higher vegetation diversity and complexity of the set-aside land which additionally influenced the catches. Pitfalls recovered higher numbers of animals and species, and species composition differed significantly between pitfalls and photoeclectors, in the field as well as in the set-aside. Body size seemed to be the main factor in determining the catch, the relatively larger species being more frequently caught by pitfall traps. In sum, the relationship between pitfall trap catches and actual population densities appeared to be either absent, weak or highly variable among taxa, habitat and time of the season. Thus numbers caught in pitfall traps cannot be considered as reliable indices of “real” abundance nor do they reflect the relative abundance within a given predator community correctly. Therefore, in most cases absolute density estimates should be preferred for the study of epigeal invertebrates in arable land. However, I suggest a combination of both pitfall traps and standardised area samples, because the two approaches possibly provide information of different qualities equally important for the evaluation of epigeal predator species, namely searching activity and population density.},

Marked starved and satiated individuals were released in the enclosures and recaptured during 8 days. Initial satiation state had a significant effect on activity. Also, the initial displacements of beetles depended both on the habitat and on the initial satiation state. P. melanarius appeared to have flexible habitat-use, depending mainly on three factors: the satiation state, the habitat preference of the species, and the prey availability in the habitat.},

  abstract = {Pterostichus melanarius (Coleoptera: Carabidae) is a Palearctic generalist predator native to Europe that was introduced to North America in the 1920’s and has since become widespread in the United States. This beetle is non-native to the U.S., yet appears to have little to no negative effect on native carabids and is a critical natural enemy in agricultural systems, especially because it feeds on the invasive gray garden slug Deroceras reticulatum. My thesis begins with a review that compiles in one publication the details of P. melanarius distribution, life history, diet, and factors that influence its populations. I used ecological niche modeling to determine the current potential range of P. melanarius in the United States and found that annual mean temperature and precipitation of the driest month were the most important factors to determine probable habitat suitability. My second chapter investigates the effects of crop rotation and integrated pest management on pests and natural enemies in no-till cropping systems in central Pennsylvania. Overall, I found that diversified rotations that implemented continuous crop cover with perennial forages and cover crops and incorporated IPM enhanced the abundance of natural enemies early in the growing season and can suppress pests to similar levels attained by simple rotations managed with Bt hybrids, pesticidal seed treatments, and prophylactic pesticide application. I also found that protecting and increasing carabid abundance, especially P. melanarius, is important for slug control and can be achieved by reducing tillage, increasing crop species diversity, and using integrated pest management. Lastly, I examined the predator-prey relationship between ground beetles and slugs by investigating non-consumptive effects of P. melanarius on D. reticulatum behavior and physiology. I found that combined physical and chemical cues of P. melanarius induced fear behavior in D. reticulatum that resulted in increased hiding and decreased foraging by D. reticulatum. Due to the ineffectiveness of radioimmunoassays, I could not determine a physiological fear response. Nevertheless, there appear to be non-consumptive effects, which suggest that the pest management value of ground beetle predators such as Pterostichus melanarius may be underestimated in agricultural systems.},

Pitfall captures of carabids and disappearance rate of experimentally placed fly pupae were similar across the intercrop of peas and barley and monocultures of faba bean and barley, but pupal disappearance was lower in plots of fescue grass than in the crops. In habitat choice experiments, the intercrop attracted significantly more individuals of Pterostichus melanarius Illiger than did the three monocultures. Our results show that carabids can be affected by vegetation structure associated with differences in agronomic practice and that such effects have potential implication for rates of predation in agricultural systems},

The eigenvalue and singular value decompositions of the corresponding smoother matrix are used to describe qualitatively a smoother, and several other topics such as the number of degrees of freedom of a smoother are discussed. In the second part of the paper we describe how linear smoothers can be used to estimate the additive model, a powerful nonparametric regression model, using the "back-fitting algorithm." We show that backfitting is the Gauss-Seidel iterative method for solving a set of normal equations associated with the additive model. We provide conditions for consistency and nondegeneracy and prove convergence for the backfitting and related algorithms for a class of smoothers that includes cubic spline smoothers.},

If concurvity, the nonparametric analogue of multicollinearity, is present in the data, statistical software such as S-plus can seriously underestimate the variance of fitted model parameters, leading to significance tests with inflated type 1 error. This paper uses computer simulation and analyses of actual epidemiologic data to explore this underestimation of standard errors. We provide a method for assessing concurvity in data and an alternate class of models that is unaffected by concurvity. We argue that some degree of concurvity is likely to be present in all epidemiologic time series datasets and we explore through the use of meta-analysis the possible impact of concurvity on the existing body of work relating ambient levels of sulfate particles to mortality.},

After removing age effects through a novel approach, this study quantifies the effects on tree growth of global change, and assesses the relationship with individual environmental drivers and their relative importance. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) were applied to decouple the non-linear effects of age and co-occurring environmental changes on basal area increments (BAI) series, as derived from tree rings in a Pseudotsuga menziesii stand chronosequence of four different age classes (65-, 80-, 100- and 120-year-old). The model could explain about 57% of the overall variation in BAI as a function of age and a selected set of predictors, including water availability in the current summer and at the end of previous growing season; together with age, winter-spring mean temperature was found to be the most important predictor. After accounting for age-related effects, a significant decrease in BAI was observed in Douglas fir over the last decades. No significant impact of atmospheric [CO2] and atmospheric N deposition were detected.},

When the data to which the GAM are being applied have two characteristics—1) the estimated regression coefficients are small and 2) there exist confounding factors that are modeled using at least two nonparametric smooth functions—the default settings in the gam function of the S-Plus software package (version 3.4) do not assure convergence of its iterative estimation procedure and can provide biased estimates of regression coefficients and standard errors. This phenomenon has occurred in time-series analyses of contemporary data on air pollution and mortality. To evaluate the impact of default implementation of the gam software on published analyses, the authors reanalyzed data from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) using three different methods: 1) Poisson regression with parametric nonlinear adjustments for confounding factors; 2) GAM with default convergence parameters; and 3) GAM with more stringent convergence parameters than the default settings. The authors found that pooled NMMAPS estimates were very similar under the first and third methods but were biased upward under the second method.},

Over five years, 13,654 ground beetles representing 107 different species were captured. Of these, 14 species represented 85% of the captured beetles. Based on habitat use, we categorized 24 as generalist species, 14 as agricultural species, 12 as grassland species, 39 as prairie specialists, and 19 as woodland species. Tallgrass prairie hosted a significantly more (P < 0.05) diverse assemblage of ground beetles than was found in the other habitats. Prairie also had a higher percentage of habitat specialists in its assemblage than did the less stable agricultural habitats which were dominated by generalists. NMS ordination and indicator species analysis revealed distinct ground beetle assemblages and identified indicator species in the various habitats, allowing species assemblages to be used as habitat indicators.},

Some insects prefer to feed on other plants that are growing in fields of oilseed crops and will feed more readily on the oilseed crop only when the more preferred host diminishes or is destroyed. The principal orders of insects found in fields of oilseed crops include Orthoptera, Thysanoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and  Hymenoptera.  Several species of spiders and mites  also  comprise  a  substantial  component  of  the  arthropod biodiversity of oilseed crops.

  abstract  = {Wildflower strips are a management practice increasingly used to provide floral resources to wild bees in agroecosystems. Yet, despite known spatiotemporal variation in wild bee communities, the degree to which different wildflower strip species consistently support wild bee communities is poorly understood. Additionally, whether such consistency is related to the functional roles wildflower species play (e.g., in supporting diverse, rare, or unique suites of bee species) has not been considered. Over three years and on four diversified farms, we evaluated spatiotemporal variation in wild bee communities and bee-flower interactions in wildflower strips to better understand the roles of flower strip species in supporting bees. We documented spatiotemporal variation in the abundance, richness, and composition of local wild bee communities. Certain wildflower species consistently supported the highest richness of wild bees across years. These wildflower species were regularly core members of the bee-flower interaction network, visited by both generalist and specialist bees. By contrast, wildflower species supporting the most unique suites of bees were variable in this role among farms. In order to select plant species for wildflower strips that consistently support a high diversity of wild bee communities within farm landscapes, it is useful to consider several different functional roles that plants may play. Whereas a handful of wildflower species may be visited by the majority of local wild bee species, achieving support for the remaining, and perhaps rarer, bee species will require planting additional flower species, which may appear redundant until the spatiotemporal variation in wild bee communities is more thoroughly considered. This functional approach to selecting wildflower species for bee conservation efforts is important for making practical recommendations to land managers and for guiding best management practices in different regions and with diverse management goals.},

  abstract  = {Context: Landscape spatio-temporal heterogeneity is regarded as an important driver of biodiversity. In agricultural landscapes, the composition and configuration of cultivated fields and their multi-year dynamics should be considered. But the habitat-matrix paradigm in landscape ecology has resulted in little consideration of cropped areas.

Objectives: The main objective of our study was to determine the influences of spatial and multi-year temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic on carabid beetle assemblages of agricultural landscapes.

Methods: Carabids were sampled in 40 cereal fields in western France, and their species richness, total abundance and abundance of species groups with different dispersal abilities were measured. For each sampling site, we computed different metrics that characterized crop mosaic spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We quantified relationships between carabid assemblages and heterogeneity metrics and tested their significance.

Results: Total carabid abundance increased with increase in temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic. However, all species were not influenced in the same way by spatial and temporal heterogeneity metrics. Some species with high dispersal power such as Trechus quadristriatus were more abundant in landscapes with high spatial heterogeneity, whereas the abundance of less mobile species such as Poecilus cupreus were only positively influenced by temporal crop dynamics.

Conclusions: Our results suggest that both the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic affects farmland biodiversity, at least for species that use crops during their life cycle or disperse through fields. We highlight the importance of taking this heterogeneity into account in further ecological studies on biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.},

Adults consume seedling foliage and larvae feed on Rhizobium root nodules thereby reducing nitrogen fixation; both life stages can reduce yield. Eggs and adults are vulnerable to predators and parasitoids. In 2009, a series of experiments was undertaken to identify potential indigenous natural enemies of S. lineatus in southern Alberta. In three test arenas, eggs were exposed to starved ground beetles in no‐choice tests for 48 h. Egg debris was observed when eggs were exposed to Bembidion quadrimaculatum L., Microlestes linearis (LeConte), Bembidion rupicola (Kirby), Bembidion timidum (LeConte), Poecilus scitulus LeConte, and staphylinid beetles. Of the two most abundant carabid species, the smaller B. quadrimaculatum consistently removed significantly more eggs (94.6%) than the larger Pterostichus melanarius (17.4%). Similar results were observed in Petri dish and egg card tests. No egg debris was observed in tests with Pt. melanarius . Presence of the larger beetle, Pt. melanarius , resulted in a lower rate of egg removal by the smaller B. quadrimaculatum relative to the rates observed for B. quadrimaculatum alone. Intraguild predation of B. quadrimaculatum by Pt. melanarius was observed in 47% of tests. These results suggest that B. quadrimaculatum is a potential predator of S. lineatus eggs in field pea agroecosystems and should be considered for use in conservation biological control and integrated pest management programs.},

The cropping rotation consisted of a spring cereal (barley, Hordeum vulgare L., in 2000 and 2001; and wheat, Triticum aestivum L., in 2002), spring dry pea (Pisum sativum L.) 2000–2002, and wheat (T. aestivum), spring in 2000 and 2001, and winter in 2002. A total of 14,480 beetles comprised of 30 species was captured, with five numerically dominant species [Poecilus scitulus L., Poecilus lucublandus Say, Microlestes linearis L., Pterostichus melanarius Ill., and Calosoma cancellatum (Eschscholtz)], accounting for 98% of all captures. All species including the dominants responded idiosyncratically to tillage regimen. Adjusting for trapping biases did not significantly change seasonal activity density of Poecilus spp. or Pt. melanarius to tillage. More beetles were captured in CT than in NT crops because of the dominance of P. scitulus in CT, whereas species richness and biological diversity were generally higher in NT crops. Observed patterns suggest that direct effects of tillage affected some species, whereas indirect effects related to habitat characteristics affected others. CT may provide habitat preferable to xerophilic spring breeders. A relationship was found between beetle species size and tillage regimen in pea and to a lesser extent across all spring crops, with large species (>14 mm) conserved more commonly in NT, small species (<7 mm) in CT, and intermediate species (7–14 mm) conserved equally between tillage systems.},

We studied the influence of landscape factors on activity density, adult body size and fecundity of P. agrestis in 29 winter oilseed rape fields (Brassica napus L.) in Eastern Austria using pitfall traps. Landscape data were obtained for eight circular landscape sections around each field (radii 250-2000 m). Multivariate regression models were used to analyze the data. Activity density was highest when the length of strips of grassy road-sides in the surroundings was highest and distance to the next grassy fallow lowest. Body size was negatively related to activity density and to the length of road-side strips and positively to woody areas in the vicinity of the fields. Clutch size was unrelated to any of the landscape factors tested but was positively correlated with female body size. Woody areas and grassy fallow in the close vicinity of the fields had a positive influence on number of offspring per female and total number of offspring. These results indicate that various non-crop components in the landscape surrounding oilseed rape fields can specifically influence the activity density and fitness-related traits of P. agrestis in crops. The possible role of Pardosa spp. in natural pest control is discussed.},

Linyphiid spiders, which are more likely to disperse by air than lycosids, did not show an increase in numbers over time, but were more affected by the surrounding landscape. However, these spiders also showed a dependence on time, because the positive effect of surrounding boundaries was significant in the beginning but not at the end of the study period. Thus, most spiders showed a difference in migration patterns over time and both spider families were positively influenced by the surrounding boundaries and grasslands during recolonisation of crop fields after winter. In order to enhance pest suppression by spiders, overwintering structures should be provided in crop-dominated landscapes to facilitate spider migration into crop fields during early spring.},

  abstract = {The impact of grazing has been discussed in many organisms, and it has been shown that it has considerable influence on the structural variation of vegetation, resulting in its tussocky appearance. Such spatial heterogeneity results in plants formations that facilitate other species by providing safe sites against predation and physical stress. On the Trnovski gozd plateau in western Slovenia, a secondary habitat of the rare, monotypic endemic umbelliferous species, Hladnikia pastinacifolia, was colonized by a relatively isolated population of the wide spread opilionid species, Phalangium opilio. We hypothesized that in this stony pasture, the impact of the structurally heterogenous vegetation that results from low-intensity grazing benefits both species on hot summer days. For this purpose, we classified vegetation formation types (VFT) and measured temperature and relative humidity in places settled by Ph. opilio individuals during their daily rest. According to the predominant species, we recognized six VFTs: Carlina acaulis, Ruta divaricata, Koeleria pyramidata, Juniperus communis, understory vegetation and grazed turf. Only the spiny C. acaulis and unpalatable R. divaricata facilitated H. pastinacifolia, while also acting as nurse plants. On the other hand, Ph. opilio preferred the understory, but also settled on the other VFTs, except Ruta. During the highest daily temperature of about 38°C, Ph. opilio avoided the grazed turf. Temperature preferences refer to frequencies of individuals rather than to absolute temperature values. The frequencies were independent of sex and the VFTs. Females were more frequently found in tussocks showing higher temperature profiles (Juniperus, Koeleria). During the hot daytime, Ph. opilio was most sensitive to relative humidity, and less so to temperature, whilst the height of settlement varied in adjusting these two environmental factors. The distribution of males significantly differed between the subsequent morning, midday and evening series, but not between the morning and evening ones, while in females it differed between all the three time series. In habitats, such as stony dry pastures, low grazing intensity can maintain persistent populations of H. pastinacifolia and Ph. opilio even in extremely hot weather. Such grazing is the most convenient measure for protecting both species, especially the highly endangered Hladnikia. The major threat to such habitats is afforestation by Pinus nigra, which deserves additional management. We found that in stony pastures, low grazing intensity assures the structural heterogeneity of vegetation required to maintain persistent populations, of both H. pastinacifolia and Ph. opilio.},

  abstract = {Although a great amount of ecological information about harvestmen (Opiliones) exists in the form of quantitative sampling, few attempts have been made to understand their general patterns of occurrences. As a part of the European ‘smallFOREST’-project, which aims to quantify the ecosystem services and biodiversity in small deciduous forest patches in European agricultural landscapes, we investigated harvestmen communities along a latitudinal gradient from west to northeast Europe. The harvestmen were sampled using pitfall traps in 2013. We analysed general patterns of occurrence on three different levels: (1) species richness, abundance and diversity in general, (2) ecological species groups and (3) individual species. We looked at explanatory variables that are working on different scales: latitudinal position, land use intensity in the surrounding landscape (intensive or more extensive), forest age, forest size, location of the traps within the forest (edge or centre) and the direction of the trapping (towards the edge or towards the centre). Harvestman diversity decreases towards the pole. The location within the forest has a large impact since a significant higher amount of harvestmen was found in the forest centres, especially for the species that are bound to the soil. Forest age and forest size had only a limited effect on harvestman occurrences within the sampled ranges. Since no differences in trapping direction were found, we conclude that no migration patterns exist in the sampled period. Further research is needed to understand the influence of land use intensity. A large part of the occurrence patterns might be explained by humidity since most European harvestmen species are hygrophilous and favour/need high humidity levels. Since habitat fragmentation results in smaller forests that house smaller centre areas and soil species are more abundant in the forest centres, they are expected to be the first species that will experience a negative impact.},

  abstract  = {Establishing semi-natural areas within annual croplands can provide habitat for beneficial organisms and ecosystem services to crops through a spillover effect. However, this approach to increasing landscape complexity may have no effect on crops, or it may promote pests, weeds and other disservices that reduce productivity. An argument for changing landscape complexity may be more persuasive if it is associated with higher crop yields. Here, we examine regions that vary in their landscape complexity and, therefore, may also naturally differ in the potential for ecosystem services, disservices and crop yields. Specifically, we examine crop-growing districts in the Canadian province of Alberta to test whether the presence of more non-crop land covers has increased crop yields. Our dataset covered about one-quarter of the seeded area in Canada between 2012 and 2017 consisting of 10,069 records representing average field-level yields reported to a crop insurance provider. In total, we analyzed summary data for 250,000 km2 of seeded area for seven grain crops. Using a functional regression approach, we found evidence for a plausibly positive association between yield and the non-crop land covers found within and near fields in four of seven crops. Landscape complexity, therefore, represented a measurable yield benefit for farmers, although the variance in yield explained by the landscape was small. These findings suggest there may be a low risk of disservices to crops from non-crop land covers in this region. Our study adds support at a broad geographic extent for initiatives that restore perennial and other semi-natural vegetation in annual cropping systems and suggests that, in this temperate grassland region, their promotion (e.g., as carbon stores or as biodiversity refugia) may have no adverse effects for crop production.},

We found that OTCs did not significantly reduce visitation by insects, nor did they reduce seed production in wind-pollinated S. arctica. Flower production and seed germination rates for D. integrifolia matched the predictions for warmth- and pollen-limited plants. Reproduction in P. radicatum did not respond strongly to either warming or pollination. Overall, we found that High Arctic plant reproduction is affected independently by pollination and OTC warming, indicating that plant responses to ongoing increases in temperature will not be strongly altered by changes in insect pollination.},

The study site followed a soybean, Glycine max L. Merr, oats, Avena sativa L., and corn, Zea mays L., rotation. Refuges consisted of a central strip of 3 perennial flowering plants, Agastache foeniculun (Pursh) O. Kuntze, Origanum vulgare L., and Scropularia nodosa L, with orchard grass, Dactylis glomerata L., white clover, Trifolium repens L., and sweet clover, Melilotus officinalis L., seeded on each side. A cover crop was present only in 1996 and consisted of frost seeded red clover, Trifolium pratense L. A total of 5,117 and 2,316 carabid beetles was captured in pitfall traps comprising 14 species in 1996 and 20 species in 1997. Carabid beetle seasonal activity-density was greater (1996) or equal (1997) in refuge strips than in control areas without refuge strips; however, the presence of a refuge strip did not alter carabid populations in the surrounding subplots in either year. In 1996, subplots containing a cover crop had significantly higher carabid beetle activity-density than subplots without a cover crop. There was no carryover effect of cover crop on beetle activity-density in 1997. Among the most abundant species, a greater proportion of captures of the fall breeding species Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger), Pterostichus permundus (Say), and the spring breeding species Poecilus lucublandus (Say) occurred in the refuge strips. The spring breeders Poecilus chalcites (Say), Harpalus herbivagus Say, and Agonum cupripenne (Say), and the phytophagous fall breeder Harpalus pensylvanicus (De Geer) occurred in greater proportions in the crop areas. The potential use of these strategies for conserving carabid beetles in agricultural systems is discussed.},

Two sampling methods were used to collect predators, pitfall trapping and vacuum sampling. Although there was considerable difference in the composition of species collected with each method, similar trends in overall predator abundance were observed. Generalist predator abundance followed the gradient of ground cover. The treatment with the highest degree of mulch ground cover had the highest overall predator abundance while the treatment which was disked and without surface mulch had the lowest. Although most of the common species preferred those systems with the most ground cover, several species preferred the system with the least amount of ground cover.},

  abstract = {In many cropping systems, farmers have to contend with invertebrate and vertebrate pests, but there have been few attempts to employ Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies and tactics that simultaneously manage these problems. This study tested whether or not damage to soybean from white-tailed deer could be reduced by field-edge plantings, while increasing the abundance of predatory ground beetles in the same soybean fields and subsequently reducing numbers of soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, on soybean plants. The 2012 field season had five perimeter treatments. There were no significant effects of treatment on factors of interest, but there were significantly more deer presence, deer grazing damage, and carabidae captures at areas close to field-edge as opposed to 20 m into crop field. In 2013, plot sizes were increased and treatments were decreased. The two treatments in 2013 were: alfalfa + red clover + orchard grass and soybean (control). Deer grazing damage to soybeans was significantly lower in areas adjacent to a legume + orchard grass field edge planting. Significantly more carabids were captured in field areas associated with legume + grass perimeter plantings. Soybean aphid population densities were low throughout the study and their numbers were not significantly affected by perimeter treatments. In conclusion, the results of this research suggest that field-edge plantings may be a potential technique to mitigate white-tailed deer grazing on soybean, while boosting numbers of carabid beetles in the same field.},

  abstract  = {Habitat‐selection analysis lacks an appropriate measure of the ecological significance of the statistical estimates—a practical interpretation of the magnitude of the selection coefficients. There is a need for a standard approach that allows relating the strength of selection to a change in habitat conditions across space, a quantification of the estimated effect size that can be compared both within and across studies. We offer a solution, based on the epidemiological risk ratio, which we term the relative selection strength (RSS ). For a “used‐available” design with an exponential selection function, the RSS provides an appropriate interpretation of the magnitude of the estimated selection coefficients, conditional on all other covariates being fixed. This is similar to the interpretation of the regression coefficients in any multivariable regression analysis. Although technically correct, the conditional interpretation may be inappropriate when attempting to predict habitat use across a given landscape. Hence, we also provide a simple graphical tool that communicates both the conditional and average effect of the change in one covariate. The average‐effect plot answers the question: What is the average change in the space use probability as we change the covariate of interest, while averaging over possible values of other covariates? We illustrate an application of the average‐effect plot for the average effect of distance to road on space use for elk (Cervus elaphus ) during the hunting season. We provide a list of potentially useful RSS expressions and discuss the utility of the RSS in the context of common ecological applications.},

  abstract  = {Quantifying abundance and distribution of plant species can be difficult because data are often inflated with zero values due to rarity or absence from many ecosystems. Terrestrial fruticose lichens (Cladonia and Cetraria spp.) occupy a narrow ecological niche and have been linked to the diets of declining caribou and reindeer populations (Rangifer tarandus ) across their global distribution, and conditions related to their abundance and distribution are not well understood. We attempted to measure effects related to the occupancy and abundance of terrestrial fruticose lichens by sampling and simultaneously modeling two discrete conditions: absence and abundance. We sampled the proportion cover of terrestrial lichens at 438 vegetation plots, including 98 plots having zero lichens. A zero‐inflated beta regression model was employed to simultaneously estimate both the absence and the proportion cover of terrestrial fruticose lichens using fine resolution satellite imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR ) derived covariates. The probability of lichen absence significantly increased with shallower groundwater, taller vegetation, and increased Sphagnum moss cover. Vegetation productivity, Sphagnum moss cover, and seasonal changes in photosynthetic capacity were negatively related to the abundances of terrestrial lichens. Inflated beta regression reliably estimated the abundance of terrestrial lichens (R 2 = .74) which was interpolated on a map at fine resolution across a caribou range to support ecological conservation and reclamation. Results demonstrate that sampling for and simultaneously estimating both occupancy and abundance offer a powerful approach to improve statistical estimation and expand ecological inference in an applied setting. Learnings are broadly applicable to studying species that are rare, occupy narrow niches, or where the response variable is a proportion value containing zero or one, which is typical of vegetation cover data.},

While statistical techniques are advancing at a fast pace, there is confusion in the conceptual understanding of the meaning of various quantities that these statistical techniques provide.
2. Terms such as selection, choice, use, occupancy and preference often are employed as if they are synonymous. Many practitioners are unclear about the distinctions between different concepts such as ‘probability of selection,’ ‘probability of use,’ ‘choice probabilities’ and ‘probability of occupancy’.
3. Similarly, practitioners are not always clear about the differences between and relevance of ‘relative probability of selection’ vs. ‘probability of selection’ to effective management.
4. Practitioners also are unaware that they are using only a single statistical model for modelling resource selection, namely the exponential probability of selection, when other models might be more appropriate. Currently, such multimodel inference is lacking in the resource selection literature.
5. In this paper, we attempt to clarify the concepts and terminology used in animal resource studies by illustrating the relationships among these various concepts and providing their statistical underpinnings.},

  abstract  = {1. Understanding how organisms distribute themselves in response to interacting species, ecosystems, climate, human development and time is fundamental to ecological study and practice. A measure to quantify the relationship among organisms and their environments is intensity of use: the rate of use of a specific resource in a defined unit of time. Estimating the intensity of use differs from estimating probabilities of occupancy or selection, which can remain constant even when the intensity of use varies. We describe a method to evaluate the intensity of use across conditions that vary in both space and time. We demonstrate its application on a large mammal community where linear developments and human activity are conjectured to influence the interactions between white‐tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ) and wolves (Canis lupus ) with possible consequences on threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou).
2. We collect and quantify intensity of use data for multiple, interacting species with the goal of assessing management efficacy, including a habitat restoration strategy for linear developments. We test whether blocking linear developments by spreading logs across a 200‐m interval can be applied as an immediate mitigation to reduce the intensities of use by humans, predator and prey species in a boreal caribou range.
3. We deployed camera traps on linear developments with and without restoration treatments in a landscape exposed to both timber and oil development. We collected a three‐year dataset and employed spatial recurrent event models to analyse intensity of use by an interacting human and large mammal community across a range of environmental and climatic conditions.
4. Spatial recurrent event models revealed that intensity of use by humans influenced the intensity of use by all five large mammal species evaluated, and the intensities of use by wolves and deer were inextricably linked in space and time. Conditions that resist travel on linear developments had a strong negative effect on the intensity of human and large mammal use.
5. Mitigation strategies that resist, or redirect, animal travel on linear developments can reduce the effects of resource development on interacting human and predator–prey interactions. Our approach is easily applied to other continuous time point‐based survey methodologies and shows that measuring the intensity of use within animal communities can help scientists monitor, mitigate and understand ecological states and processes.},

  abstract  = {1. Understanding space usage and resource selection is a primary focus of many studies of animal populations. Usually, such studies are based on location data obtained from telemetry, and resource selection functions (RSF s) are used for inference. Another important focus of wildlife research is estimation and modeling population size and density. Recently developed spatial capture–recapture (SCR ) models accomplish this objective using individual encounter history data with auxiliary spatial information on location of capture. SCR models include encounter probability functions that are intuitively related to RSF s, but to date, no one has extended SCR models to allow for explicit inference about space usage and resource selection.
2. In this paper we develop the first statistical framework for jointly modeling space usage, resource selection, and population density by integrating SCR data, such as from camera traps, mist‐nets, or conventional catch traps, with resource selection data from telemetered individuals. We provide a framework for estimation based on marginal likelihood, wherein we estimate simultaneously the parameters of the SCR and RSF models.
3. Our method leads to increases in precision for estimating parameters of ordinary SCR models. Importantly, we also find that SCR models alone can estimate parameters of RSFs and, as such, SCR methods can be used as the sole source for studying space‐usage; however, precision will be higher when telemetry data are available.
4. Finally, we find that SCR models using standard symmetric and stationary encounter probability models may not fully explain variation in encounter probability due to space usage, and therefore produce biased estimates of density when animal space usage is related to resource selection. Consequently, it is important that space usage be taken into consideration, if possible, in studies focused on estimating density using capture–recapture methods.},

  abstract  = {Increasing fragmentation of forests worldwide by timber and industrial development makes it important to understand the edge effects of common anthropogenic disturbances on forest fauna. We collected ground-active spiders along transects across the edge of logging clearcuts, gravel roads and gas pipelines in the boreal forest of Alberta, sampling on the disturbance (10 m from forest edge), and 10, 45, and 200 m into the forest. We asked whether the three disturbances were associated with edge effects on spider communities, and whether the extent of their associated edge effects were equivalent. The spider community at the edges of clearcuts was distinct from interior and on-disturbance communities 10 m into the forest from the clearcut edge, showing an edge effect of between 10 and 45 m from clearcut edges, while no edge effects were apparent at road and pipeline edges. Edge effects therefore differ at linear and non-linear openings in the boreal forest, which suggests that small linear openings may be associated with minimal edge effects compared to large polygonal forest openings. This result has important consequences for forest management, where clearcuts and other non-linear openings are likely to cause edge effects on spider communities that are between 10 and 45 m in their extent. The small size of clearcuts as practiced in the public forests of Canada, and their dense and broad application across the landscape, makes this edge effect of broad spatial significance in protecting biodiversity in managed landscapes.},

Overall, the species diversity of the spider community in the burned areas was not significantly different from the unburned areas for any burn season, although some significant differences occurred within the first year following the burns. Spider abundance decreased following each burn season treatment and the recovery period varied depending on the burn season. Burn season also affected the structure of the spider communities in that the summer and fall burn treatments became dominated by Pardosa distincta (Blackwall) rather than the initially dominant P. moesta Banks.

  abstract  = {Spiders are an abundant and diverse group of generalist predators in arable fields. Knowledge on what landscape and site factors affect this group can be valuable for efforts to reduce biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes and can have implications for natural pest control. We investigated the impact of landscape and site factors on epigeic spiders in 29 winter oilseed rape fields (Brassica napus , OSR) embedded in differently structured landscapes in an agricultural region east of Vienna (Austria). Landscape factors included proportions of non‐crop areas, woody areas and fallows, lengths of road‐side strips and hedges, and landscape diversity at different spatial scales (r=250–2000 m). Site factors included OSR stand density, soil index, soil cultivation intensity, nitrogen fertilisation level, OSR vegetation cover in late autumn, and insecticide applications. Data were analysed using regression, ordination, and variation partitioning. Different characteristics of spider assemblages responded to different landscape factors at different spatial scales. Observed species richness showed the strongest positive reponse to proportions of woody areas at rather small scale (radius 500 m), but the relation remained significant up to the 1250 m radius. Standardised species richness was positively related to non‐crop area at the smallest scale (radius 250 m). Activity density was positively related to length of road‐side strips with maximum effects at large scale (radius 1750 m) and non‐crop area (radius 750 m). Site characteristics (stand density, insecticide applications, and late autumn ground cover) and landscape factors (woody areas and fallows at radius 500 m) were similarly important for explaining species composition. We interpret the scale‐dependency of relations as the result of differences in dispersal power of the studied spider species. These results demonstrate the important, scale dependent influence of natural and semi‐natural habitats on spider assemblages in arable fields.},

However, different crop management practices can have a negative effect on predator populations. If so, there is a need for recolonisation by the predators to the crop fields. An important pest in Sweden is the bird cherry‐oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, which migrates to cereal fields in spring. In turn, many cereal fields are spring sown and thus are disturbed by harrowing and sowing a short time before aphid arrival. In this study, three different questions about the populations of spiders and carabids in spring cereal crops were asked. First, does sowing in spring have a negative effect on the predators present in the fields? Second, if sowing has a negative effect on predator populations, do they recolonise the fields before pest arrival? Third, how are the predators distributed in the fields? We found that most carabids and most lycosid spiders were not affected by sowing and were distributed uniformly in the fields after sowing. Most linyphiid spiders were negatively affected by sowing, but then they recolonised the fields and were uniformly distributed in the fields after recolonisation. Thus, many spiders and carabids are present in the fields after sowing in spring and have the opportunity to suppress aphids during their establishment phase, which in turn may prevent a possible outbreak.},

  abstract  = {Many agroecosystems are unfavorable environments for natural enemies due to high levels of disturbance. Habitat management, a form of conservation biological control, is an ecologically based approach aimed at favoring natural enemies and enhancing biological control in agricultural systems. The goal of habitat management is to create a suitable ecological infrastructure within the agricultural landscape to provide resources such as food for adult natural enemies, alternative prey or hosts, and shelter from adverse conditions. These resources must be integrated into the landscape in a way that is spatially and temporally favorable to natural enemies and practical for producers to implement. The rapidly expanding literature on habitat management is reviewed with attention to practices for favoring predators and parasitoids, implementation of habitat management, and the contributions of modeling and ecological theory to this developing area of conservation biological control. The potential to integrate the goals of habitat management for natural enemies and nature conservation is discussed.},

  abstract  = {To manage agroecosystems for multiple ecosystem services, we need to know whether the management of one service has positive, negative, or no effects on other services. We do not yet have data on the interactions between pollination and pest‐control services. However, we do have data on the distributions of pollinators and natural enemies in agroecosystems. Therefore, we compared these two groups of ecosystem service providers, to see if the management of farms and agricultural landscapes might have similar effects on the abundance and richness of both. In a meta‐analysis, we compared 46 studies that sampled bees, predatory beetles, parasitic wasps, and spiders in fields, orchards, or vineyards of food crops. These studies used the proximity or proportion of non‐crop or natural habitats in the landscapes surrounding these crops (a measure of landscape complexity), or the proximity or diversity of non‐crop plants in the margins of these crops (a measure of local complexity), to explain the abundance or richness of these beneficial arthropods. Compositional complexity at both landscape and local scales had positive effects on both pollinators and natural enemies, but different effects on different taxa. Effects on bees and spiders were significantly positive, but effects on parasitoids and predatory beetles (mostly Carabidae and Staphylinidae) were inconclusive. Landscape complexity had significantly stronger effects on bees than it did on predatory beetles and significantly stronger effects in non‐woody rather than in woody crops. Effects on richness were significantly stronger than effects on abundance, but possibly only for spiders. This abundance‐richness difference might be caused by differences between generalists and specialists, or between arthropods that depend on non‐crop habitats (ecotone species and dispersers) and those that do not (cultural species). We call this the ‘specialist‐generalist’ or ‘cultural difference’ mechanism. If complexity has stronger effects on richness than abundance, it might have stronger effects on the stability than the magnitude of these arthropod‐mediated ecosystem services. We conclude that some pollinators and natural enemies seem to have compatible responses to complexity, and it might be possible to manage agroecosystems for the benefit of both. However, too few studies have compared the two, and so we cannot yet conclude that there are no negative interactions between pollinators and natural enemies, and no trade‐offs between pollination and pest‐control services. Therefore, we suggest a framework for future research to bridge these gaps in our knowledge.},

  abstract  = {Wild bees provide a free and potentially diverse ecosystem service to farmers growing pollination‐dependent crops. While many crops benefit from insect pollination, soft fruit crops, including strawberries are highly dependent on this ecosystem service to produce viable fruit. However, as a result of intensive farming practices and declining pollinator populations, farmers are increasingly turning to commercially reared bees to ensure that crops are adequately pollinated throughout the season. Wildflower strips are a commonly used measure aimed at the conservation of wild pollinators. It has been suggested that commercial crops may also benefit from the presence of noncrop flowers; however, the efficacy and economic benefits of sowing flower strips for crops remain relatively unstudied. In a study system that utilizes both wild and commercial pollinators, we test whether wildflower strips increase the number of visits to adjacent commercial strawberry crops by pollinating insects. We quantified this by experimentally sowing wildflower strips approximately 20 meters away from the crop and recording the number of pollinator visits to crops with, and without, flower strips. Between June and August 2013, we walked 292 crop transects at six farms in Scotland, recording a total of 2826 pollinators. On average, the frequency of pollinator visits was 25% higher for crops with adjacent flower strips compared to those without, with a combination of wild and commercial bumblebees (Bombus spp.) accounting for 67% of all pollinators observed. This effect was independent of other confounding effects, such as the number of flowers on the crop, date, and temperature. Synthesis and applications . This study provides evidence that soft fruit farmers can increase the number of pollinators that visit their crops by sowing inexpensive flower seed mixes nearby. By investing in this management option, farmers have the potential to increase and sustain pollinator populations over time.},

  abstract  = {The relationship between movement and population dynamics in heterogeneous environments has been approached from two directions: theoretical analyses using diffusion models and empirical studies that often employ computer simulations. In this paper I am proposing a unified framework for studying individual movements that brings both of these approaches together. The proposed framework is based on the "diffusion-approximation" procedure developed by Patlak (1953a, b), which translates a probabilistic description of the pattern of individual movements (such as provided by simulation models) into a partial differential model describing the population redistribution in a patchy habitat. My first goal is this paper was to make Patlak's work accessible to ecologists interested in realistic movement models. Secondly, making some simplifying assumptions I solved Patlick's model to obtain the equilibrium distribution of organisms among patches in a heterogeneous environment. This led me to a definition of @'residence index.@' The residence index of a patch is estimated by observing and recording movement trajectories of organisms within the patch. The pattern of variation in the residence index among different kinds of patches specifies the predicted equilibrium densities of organisms in each patch. I assessed the utility of the above approach by using data on movement tracks of Euphydryas anicia females to calculate butterfly residence indices in host-plant patches vs. nonhost environment. The predicted distribution of butterflies among host and nonhost areas differed by only 16% from the actual distribution, as documented by an independent data set. I also applied the model to data from three studies on insect movement and spatial distribution. The accuracy of model predictions varied from adequate to excellent. Finally, I argue that Patlak's model and its residence-index extension provides a general, and at the same time realistic, framework for quantifying individual movements, and for relating movement patterns to spatial population dynamics. Although this approach, as developed here, is explicitly concerned only with population redistribution within an area, birth/death or immigration/emigration terms can be added in a straightforward manner. Thus, this framework can be very useful in studies of consumer-resource (e.g., predator-prey or herbivore-host) spatial dynamics, since movement behaviors of consumers searching for prey, and prey attempting to avoid consumers, are known to be important in affecting the outcome of such population interactions.},

  abstract  = {Rising demands for agricultural products and high environmental costs of intensive agriculture reinforce the need for ecological replacements in agricultural management. In Europe, agri‐environmental schemes (AES ) are implemented to enhance species richness and provision of ecosystem services, but the effectiveness of different AES types and the spatial extent of possible beneficial effects are little understood. In this study, we assessed the effects of different AES types on diversity, species traits and distance‐decay functions of ground‐dwelling predators in adjacent crop fields.

On 31 study sites with winter oilseed rape (OSR ) adjacent to four types of AES differing in management intensity and habitat age, we recorded ground‐dwelling predators (carabid beetles, staphylinid beetles and spiders) during OSR growth from April to July. Effects of the AES on species richness, activity densities and different traits of these taxa were examined with transects of pitfall traps running along a continuous distance gradient from the AES across the habitat border into the OSR fields.

Ground‐dwelling predator communities benefitted similarly from the different AES types. In adjacent OSR , activity densities, carabid species richness and the proportion of predatory carabid beetles declined from the field edge, while mean body size increased. Adjacent AES increased the proportion of predatory species and simultaneously decreased the proportion of granivorous or frugivorous species in adjacent OSR fields.

Synthesis and applications . Our results indicate a beneficial effect of adjacent agri‐environmental schemes (AES ) on ground‐dwelling predators in oilseed rape (OSR ), mostly irrespective of agri‐environmental schemes type and therefore management intensity and habitat age. The short‐ranged distance‐decay effects on natural enemies in oilseed rape underpin that a strategic spatial placement of agri‐environmental schemes in agricultural landscapes is required to maximize biological pest control. This could help replace anthropogenic input in modern agriculture and secure adequate yields.},

  abstract  = {Increasing natural pest control in agricultural fields is an important aim of ecological intensification. Combined effects of landscape context and local placement of agri‐environmental schemes (AES) on natural pest control and within‐field distance functions of natural pest control agents have rarely been addressed but might affect the distribution of biocontrol providers. Importantly, it is currently unknown whether ecosystem services provided by adjacent AES are consistent for different crop types during crop rotation.

In this study, we assessed whether crop rotation from oilseed rape to cereals altered within‐field distance functions of ground‐dwelling predators from adjacent agri‐environmental fields along a gradient in landscape context. Additionally, we recorded crop pests, predation rates, parasitoids as well as crop yields on a total of 30 study sites.

Distance functions varied between trophic levels: Carabid richness decreased while densities of carabid beetles, staphylinid beetles as well as crop yields increased towards the field centres. Distance functions of parasitoids and pests were modulated by the amount of semi‐natural habitat in the surrounding landscape, while the effects of adjacent AES were limited.

Distance decay functions found for ground‐dwelling predators in oilseed rape in the previous year were not always present in cereals. Increasing distance to the field edge also increased effects of crop rotation on carabid beetle assemblages, indicating a source habitat function of field edges.

Synthesis and applications: Distance functions of natural pest control are not universal and the effects of agri‐environmental schemes (AES) in different adjacent crops during crop rotation vary and depend on ecological contrasts. A network of semi‐natural habitats and spatially optimized AES habitats can benefit pest control in agricultural landscapes, but constraints as a result of crop type need to be addressed by annually targeted, spatially shifting agri‐environment schemes for different crops.},

  abstract  = {Arthropod diversity in agricultural areas is influenced by land‐use intensity (LUI) at both local and landscape scales. In agricultural systems, non‐crop habitats are important for promoting in‐field arthropod diversity, although in perennial orchard systems, boundary contrast (i.e. structural differences between crop and non‐crop habitats) may impede spillover of arthropods from non‐crop areas.

We focus on ground‐dwelling arthropods sampled within orchards in the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve, South Africa, that do not show a strong association with this habitat type (i.e. ‘non‐cultural’ species), and assess the influence of local (in‐field scale; FLUI) and landscape scale LUI (LLUI), boundary contrast, cover‐crop management, and population effects on species richness, assemblage variation within orchards, and the dissimilarity between assemblages in crop and non‐crop habitats (i.e. ‘cross‐edge dissimilarity’).

Higher LLUI (lower amounts of non‐crop habitat) was associated with higher in‐field species richness but also higher cross‐edge dissimilarity (i.e. these habitats were more distinct in certain landscapes). FLUI was important for non‐cultural species, especially non‐cultural predators and detritivores, for which higher levels of fertilization reduced in‐field species richness. Reduced contrast enhanced in‐field species richness, but there was limited evidence that this enhanced spillover from non‐crop habitats.

Synthesis and applications. In production systems with high border contrast and highly productive crop habitats, higher landscape scale land‐use intensity can enhance in‐field diversity. By supporting a subset of the assemblage able to thrive in both crop and non‐crop habitats, this is contributing to community divergence. To promote farmland diversity, we advocate the reduction of agrochemical inputs, production diversification at the landscapes scale, and the incorporation of a network of non‐crop corridors and stepping‐stone habitats to maintain connectivity and resilience across the landscape.},

We investigated the influence of landscape heterogeneity and composition on the pitfall trap catch of Carabidae, Araneae, and Opiliones in soybean fields. Although we hypothesized that each predator group would increase with landscape heterogeneity and the amount of semi-natural habitat; we found variation in the response of the study organisms. The activity density of Araneae supported our hypothesis, increasing in soybean fields in landscapes with an abundance of forests and grasslands. The diversity of Carabidae in soybean fields increased in landscapes with an abundance of grassland habitat but the activity density of Carabidae declined. This decline was driven extensively by the species Poecilus chalcites which was less abundant in fields located within grassland-rich landscapes. Opiliones declined with increasing landscape heterogeneity but increased within forested landscapes. The spatial scale at which taxa responded to landscape composition also varied. Our hypothesis was that dispersal capacity would influence the spatial scale at which ground-dwelling arthropods responded to landscape structure. We found that Carabidae, which generally disperse by walking, responded to smaller spatial scales than linyphiid spiders, which frequently balloon. However, Lycosidae and Opiliones which also disperse mainly by walking as adults responded at larger spatial scales. These data suggest that understanding taxon-specific relationships to landscape variables should be considered in analyses of arthropod response to landscape structure.},

Five families included 61% of the species reported in field crops: Salticidae (89 spp.), Linyphiidae (78), Araneidae (77), Theridiidae (64), and Lycosidae (62). Considerably more species have been observed in cotton (308 spp.), soybean (262), and alfalfa (233) than in guar (52), rice (75), and grain sorghum (88). Intermediate numbers of species have been observed in peanuts (131), corn (136), and sugarcane (137). The North American spider fauna is estimated at the species level to be 59% web-spinners and 41% wanderers, while those reported from field crops are estimated to be 44% web-spinners and 56% wanderers. These differences may be attributable to guild characteristics associated with dispersal and ability to survive in disturbed habitats. The 42 most frequently occurring spider species were considered in detail and demonstrated that the active wandering guild comprised the largest portion (45%) of this group. Orb-web (21%), sheet-web (19%), ambush-wander (10%), and web-matrix (5%) spiders represented other guilds. The most frequently occurring species in field crops were Oxyopes salticus Hentz (Oxyopidae), Phidippus audax (Hentz) (Salticidae), and Tetragnatha laboriosa Hentz (Araneidae). These three species are prime candidates for augmentation and conservation in field crops or in adjacent habitats as part of a strategy to increase predation on crop pests.},

- Spatiotemporal landscape dynamics lead to tradeoffs in pest density and control.

Declines in functional biodiversity, caused by changing structure and composition of agricultural landscapes, endanger the provision and stability of important ecosystem services, such as biological pest control. Understanding how spatiotemporal landscape changes affect the dynamics of pests, natural enemies and their activity can help safeguard and improve pest control in crops. Here, we tested the influence of spatial and temporal differences in landscape composition of crops (landscape-wide crop rotation diversity and % pest host crops) on the density and seasonal variability of cabbage pests, parasitoids and rates of aphid parasitism and predation. We also tested whether low seasonal variability of pests and parasitoids translates into stable and high pest control, reduced crop damage and higher yields. We show that landscapes with diverse crop rotations increased aphid parasitism, but also leaf-chewing pest density and seasonal stability. Leaf-chewing pest density decreased with increasing % host crops from year to year, suggesting a dilution effect. However, parasitoid density increased in these landscapes. We found no relationship between predation or parasitism and crop damage or yield. Further, stable parasitoid populations led to more stable parasitism rates. These findings highlight that impacts of spatially and temporally changing landscapes are pest- and enemy-specific, and tradeoffs for landscape management may occur. Appropriately managing the diversity and composition of arable crops in farmed landscapes may help influence species occurrences, without converting fertile land to non-crop habitat.},

However, generalist arthropods may also spill over from land-use systems to natural areas (mainly grassland) modifying interactions therein. A view of land-use systems as sources and natural habitats as sinks is consistent with the idea that the direction of the organisms' fluxes is from high to low productivity systems, while noncrop habitats are important sources for recolonization of arable fields after they are cleared for harvest. From the perspective of landscape management, enhancement of population exchanges between crop and noncrop areas may include beneficial as well as unwelcome interactions.},

However, estimating R2 for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called Inline Formula for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},

  abstract = {1. In agricultural landscapes, arthropods provide essential ecosystem services such as biological pest control and pollination. Intensified crop management practices and homogenization of landscapes have led to declines among such organisms. Semi‐natural habitats, associated with high numbers of these organisms, are increasingly lost from agricultural landscapes but diversification by increasing crop diversity has been proposed as a way to reverse observed arthropod declines and thus restore ecosystem services. However, whether or not an increase in the diversity of crop types within a landscape promotes diversity and abundances of pollinating and predaceous arthropods, and how semi‐natural habitats might modify this relationship, are not well understood.
2. To test how crop diversity and the proportion of semi‐natural habitats within a landscape are related to the diversity and abundance of beneficial arthropod communities, we collected primary data from seven studies focusing on natural enemies (carabids and spiders) and pollinators (bees and hoverflies) from 154 crop fields in Southern Sweden between 2007 and 2017.
3. Crop diversity within a 1‐km radius around each field was positively related to the Shannon diversity index of carabid and pollinator communities in landscapes rich in semi‐natural habitats. Abundances were mainly affected by the proportion of semi‐natural habitats in the landscape, with decreasing carabid and increasing pollinator numbers as the proportion of this habitat type increased. Spiders showed no response to either crop diversity or the proportion of semi‐natural habitats.
4. Synthesis and applications. We show that the joint effort of preserving semi‐natural habitats and promoting crop diversity in agricultural landscapes is necessary to enhance communities of natural enemies and pollinators. Our results suggest that increasing the diversity of crop types can contribute to the conservation of service‐providing arthropod communities, particularly if the diversification of crops targets complex landscapes with a high proportion of semi‐natural habitats.},

  abstract  = {1. We consider the movement of carabid beetles in a fragmented woodland landscape. Landscape ecology has lacked a formal framework for the analysis of dynamics of this kind, and stochastic spatial simulations have generally been needed to gain insight.

2. We first define an individual‐based stochastic model for movement in a heterogeneous landscape. From this a deterministic approximation is derived which describes the build‐up in association of the beetles with their environment; the deterministic model makes use of a second‐order spatial moment. It is shown that the results of the deterministic approximation match closely those of the underlying stochastic process. On this basis we suggest that the dynamical system provides a formal framework for the dynamics of animal movements in ecological landscapes.

3. The results show that the beetles, starting from an initial random layout, rapidly become associated with the woodlands and, by the time 100 days have elapsed, the association is close to its asymptotic state. The strength of the association depends very much on the spatial auto‐covariance function of the environment.

4. A number of extensions are suggested, including landscapes comprising multiple habitats of different degrees of suitability, landscapes that change through human activity, birth and death processes of single species, and interactions between species. The method of moments provides a flexible basis for future work in this area.},

The four insect services for which we provide value estimates—dung burial, pest control, pollination, and wildlife nutrition—were chosen not because of their importance but because of the availability of data and an algorithm for their estimation. We base our estimations of the value of each service on projections of losses that would accrue if insects were not functioning at their current level. We estimate the annual value of these ecological services provided in the United States to be at least $57 billion, an amount that justifies greater investment in the conservation of these services.},

  abstract  = {The idea that noncrop habitat enhances pest control and represents a win–win opportunity to conserve biodiversity and bolster yields has emerged as an agroecological paradigm. However, while noncrop habitat in landscapes surrounding farms sometimes benefits pest predators, natural enemy responses remain heterogeneous across studies and effects on pests are inconclusive. The observed heterogeneity in species responses to noncrop habitat may be biological in origin or could result from variation in how habitat and biocontrol are measured. Here, we use a pest-control database encompassing 132 studies and 6,759 sites worldwide to model natural enemy and pest abundances, predation rates, and crop damage as a function of landscape composition. Our results showed that although landscape composition explained significant variation within studies, pest and enemy abundances, predation rates, crop damage, and yields each exhibited different responses across studies, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing in landscapes with more noncrop habitat but overall showing no consistent trend. Thus, models that used landscape-composition variables to predict pest-control dynamics demonstrated little potential to explain variation across studies, though prediction did improve when comparing studies with similar crop and landscape features. Overall, our work shows that surrounding noncrop habitat does not consistently improve pest management, meaning habitat conservation may bolster production in some systems and depress yields in others. Future efforts to develop tools that inform farmers when habitat conservation truly represents a win–win would benefit from increased understanding of how landscape effects are modulated by local farm management and the biology of pests and their enemies.},

  abstract  = {Ecologists and farmers often have contrasting perceptions about the value of natural habitat in agricultural production landscapes, which so far has been little acknowledged in ecology and conservation. Ecologists and conservationists often appreciate the contribution of natural habitat to biodiversity and potential ecosystem services such as biological pest control, whereas many farmers see habitat remnants as a waste of cropland or source of pests. While natural habitat has been shown to increase pest control in many systems, we here identify five hypotheses for when and why natural habitat can fail to support biological pest control, and illustrate each with case studies from the literature: (1) pest populations have no effective natural enemies in the region, (2) natural habitat is a greater source of pests than natural enemies, (3) crops provide more resources for natural enemies than does natural habitat, (4) natural habitat is insufficient in amount, proximity, composition, or configuration to provide large enough enemy populations needed for pest control, and (5) agricultural practices counteract enemy establishment and biocontrol provided by natural habitat. In conclusion, we show that the relative importance of natural habitat for biocontrol can vary dramatically depending on type of crop, pest, predator, land management, and landscape structure. This variation needs to be considered when designing measures aimed at enhancing biocontrol services through restoring or maintaining natural habitat.},

However, no quantitative synthesis of this literature beyond simple vote‐count methods yet exists. We conducted a meta‐analysis of 46 landscape‐level studies, and found that natural enemies have a strong positive response to landscape complexity. Generalist enemies show consistent positive responses to landscape complexity across all scales measured, while specialist enemies respond more strongly to landscape complexity at smaller scales. Generalist enemy response to natural habitat also tends to occur at larger spatial scales than for specialist enemies, suggesting that land management strategies to enhance natural pest control should differ depending on whether the dominant enemies are generalists or specialists. The positive response of natural enemies does not necessarily translate into pest control, since pest abundances show no significant response to landscape complexity. Very few landscape‐scale studies have estimated enemy impact on pest populations, however, limiting our understanding of the effects of landscape on pest control. We suggest focusing future research efforts on measuring population dynamics rather than static counts to better characterise the relationship between landscape complexity and pest control services from natural enemies.},

Advances in theory and practical techniques have allowed habitat management to become an important subdiscipline of pest management. Improved understanding of biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships means that researchers now have a firmer theoretical foundation on which to design habitat management strategies for pest suppression in agricultural systems, including landscape-scale effects. Supporting natural enemies with shelter, nectar, alternative prey/hosts, and pollen (SNAP) has emerged as a major research topic and applied tactic with field tests and adoption often preceded by rigorous laboratory experimentation. As a result, the promise of habitat management is increasingly being realized in the form of practical worldwide implementation. Uptake is facilitated by farmer participation in research and is made more likely by the simultaneous delivery of ecosystem services other than pest suppression.},

Crop losses due to these harmful organisms can be substantialand may be prevented, or reduced, by crop protection measures. An overview is given on differenttypes of crop losses as well as on various methods of pest control developed during the last century.Estimates on potential and actual losses despite the current crop protection practices are givenfor wheat, rice, maize, potatoes, soybeans, and cotton for the period 2001–03 on a regional basis(19 regions) as well as for the global total. Among crops, the total global potential loss due topests varied from about 50% in wheat to more than 80% in cotton production. The responses areestimated as losses of 26–29% for soybean, wheat and cotton, and 31, 37 and 40% for maize, rice andpotatoes, respectively. Overall, weeds produced the highest potential loss (34%), with animal pestsand pathogens being less important (losses of 18 and 16%). The efficacy of crop protection washigher in cash crops than in food crops. Weed control can be managed mechanically or chemically,therefore worldwide efficacy was considerably higher than for the control of animal pests or diseases,which rely heavily on synthetic chemicals. Regional differences in efficacy are outlined. Despite a clearincrease in pesticide use, crop losses have not significantly decreased during the last 40 years.However, pesticide use has enabled farmers to modify production systems and to increase cropproductivity without sustaining the higher losses likely to occur from an increased susceptibility to thedamaging effect of pests.The concept of integrated pest/crop management includes a threshold concept for the applicationof pest control measures and reduction in the amount/frequency of pesticides applied to an econ-omically and ecologically acceptable level. Often minor crop losses are economically acceptable;however, an increase in crop productivity without adequate crop protection does not make sense,because an increase in attainable yields is often associated with an increased vulnerability to damageinflicted by pests.},

However, a model incorporating behavioral heterogeneity between individuals, and within individuals over time, was able to account for observed patterns of spread. Our results suggest that the main challenge for scaling up movement patterns resides in the complexities of individual behavior rather than in the spatial structure of the landscape.},

Although the potential importance of P. opilio has been recognized, little is known about this harvestman’s development or reproductive biology. We investigated the influence of diet on development time, survival, reproduction, and female longevity. We compared the effects of two diets, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) eggs and Aphis glycines Matsumura, on development of P. opilio because this predator is known to feed on those prey in soybean agroecosystems. Individuals fed A. glycines from emergence to adulthood suffered from higher mortality, longer development time, and smaller body size than those fed H. zea eggs. Four diet treatments were used in a separate study to test their effects on reproduction: standard laboratory diet (cornmeal, bacon, and H. zea eggs), H. zea eggs only, A. glycines only, and mixed diet (A. glycines and H. zea eggs). A diet of A. glycines alone yielded higher mortality, smaller body size, and lower fecundity than the standard laboratory diet. The presence of A. glycines in a monotypic or mixed diet lengthened the preoviposition period compared with diets without this prey and yielded a smaller first clutch and smaller average clutch sizes compared with the standard laboratory diet. A. glycines is detrimental to the growth and reproduction of this predator.},

Flower strips, but not hedgerows, enhanced pest control services in adjacent fields by 16% on average. However, effects on crop pollination and yield were more variable. Our synthesis identifies several important drivers of variability in effectiveness of plantings: pollination services declined exponentially with distance from plantings, and perennial and older flower strips with higher flowering plant diversity enhanced pollination more effectively. These findings provide promising pathways to optimise floral plantings to more effectively contribute to ecosystem service delivery and ecological intensification of agriculture in the future.},

Density estimates were lower than reported for other Pardosa species; they ranged from 0.46 per m2 for male P. mackenziana to 2.99 per m2 for immature P. mackenziana. Adult female densities were below 1 per m2 for both species. Clutch sizes were highly variable and averaged (± SE) 33.06 ± 1.29 for P. moesta and 48.37 ± 1.67 for P. mackenziana. Although clutch size was positively related to female size, little of the variation was adequately explained by female size alone.

Females carry egg sacs into the summer months and immature spiders overwinter following the first growing season when they are still less than 5 mg in weight. After a second summer of growth, sub-adults overwinter and maturation occurs early in the spring.},

  abstract = {Sustainable agriculture aims to produce sufficient food while minimizing environmental damage. To achieve this, we need to understand the role of agricultural landscapes in providing diverse ecosystem services and how these affect crop production and resilience, that is, maintaining yields despite environmental perturbation.

We used 10 years of English wheat yield data to derive three metrics of resilience (relative yield across the time series, yield stability around a moving average and resistance to an extreme weather event) at 10 km × 10 km resolution. We used remotely sensed maps to calculate measures of landscape structure, including composition (proportions of different land cover types) and configuration (metrics of connectivity and proximity), known to affect ecosystem service delivery (e.g. control of pests by beneficial invertebrates). We then used an information‐theoretic approach to identify the best‐fitting combination of landscape structure predictors for each resilience metric, using a potential yield model to account for the effects of climate and soils.

Relative yield showed a strongly positive relationship with the area of arable land. For yield stability, this relationship was evident but alongside other landscape structure variables in the best‐fitting model. No relationship with arable land was evident for resistance.

Yield stability showed a strongly positive effect of proximity to semi‐natural habitats. For resistance, the best‐fitting model included positive relationships with the cover of semi‐natural habitats and proximity to semi‐natural grasslands.

Synthesis and applications. Landscapes with the highest relative wheat yields did not show the highest yield stability or resistance to extreme events. As resilience metrics were derived from shorter portions of the time series, the importance of semi‐natural habitats compared to arable land increased. This is probably driven by the complex interplay between landscape structure, agricultural management and ecosystem services. These results demonstrate that measuring relative yield over time may be insufficient to capture the full effect that non‐arable components of the landscape, and the ecosystem services they deliver, have on other aspects of resilience, and that there are clear trade‐offs in managing agricultural landscapes to maximize different aspects of crop yield resilience.},

We selected eight landscape sections with different landscape composition. The landscapes were analysed in 7 radii ranging from 500 to 2000 m (step size: 250 m). It is shown that the population as a whole exhibits a moderate genetic differentiation with geographically restricted genetic exchange. Genetic diversity of local populations is high. It is positively associated with increasing numbers of migrants estimated from the molecular data. This indicates that even widespread species with a presumed low dispersal capacity may exhibit high levels of genetic exchange at larger spatial scales. The availability of grassland within the landscape sections enhanced genetic diversity of local populations at larger spatial scales and explained over 50% of the observed genetic diversity. Thus, the unexpectedly high genetic exchange of C. auratus critically depends on the availability of suitable landscape features. Our results emphasise the need to take into account the adverse effects of ongoing changes in landscape composition on the genetic diversity even of widespread species when aiming at conserving genetic and functional diversity in agricultural landscapes.},

  abstract  = {1. Pitfall traps are widely used for investigating ground‐dwelling arthropods, but have been heavily criticized due to their species‐, habitat‐ and attractant‐specific trapping radius which produces unreliable estimation of species diversity and density.
2. We developed a two‐circle method (TCM) for simultaneously estimating densities of ground‐dwelling arthropods and the effective trapping radius. Multiple pairs of traps are located different distances apart, and the intersection of trapping areas can be calculated using the inverse trigonometric function. The density and effective trapping radius can be estimated from a nonlinear regression of the change in the total number of individuals caught with the distance between the paired pitfall traps.
3. We compared the performance of TCM with the estimator based on the nested‐cross array (NCA) for arranging pitfall traps, by comparing predicted densities from these two methods with the real density obtained from the suction sampling method (SSM).
4. Simulations with known arthropod densities and effective trapping radius suggested that TCM produced accurate density estimation, while NCA significantly underestimated the known density. Pitfall trapping of ground‐dwelling arthropods on two habitats (crop field and desert steppe) confirmed this conclusion when comparing estimation from TCM and NCA with densities obtained from the SSM.
5. TCM is a promising technique for the density estimation of ground‐dwelling arthropods, especially for traps with liquid attractant and areas with relatively homogenous habitat and away from habitat edges.},

  abstract  = {Highlights:
- Pest and weed seed predation were measured in field defects in oilseed rape fields.
- Pest predation did not significantly differ among habitats but increased in summer.
- Weed seed predation increased in summer and varied among habitat types.
- Specific functional groups of ground beetles supported ecosystem service intensity.
- Provisioning of both ecosystem services was affected by ground-level temperatures.

Frequent extreme weather events, which jeopardize agriculture by affecting crop health, characterize the ongoing climate change. Temporary patches where sown plants are poorly developed (hereafter “field defects”) are likely to increase with climate change and can be colonized by other plant species. Although perennial non-crop habitats can act as refuges for beneficial insects in agricultural landscapes and increase ecosystem services (ESs) in neighbouring arable fields, the relevance of field defects is unknown. Here, we quantified two ESs (pest and weed seed predation) in field defects within oilseed rape crops and related the ES levels with the activity-density of ground beetles and temperature. In 10 fields, we used artificial caterpillars made of plasticine and seed cards of two weed species (Taraxacum sp. and Stellaria sp.) to quantify the ESs in two sampling periods (spring and summer) and three habitat types: field defects, crops grown in standard conditions (field interiors) and crop-defect boundaries. Ground beetles were sampled using pitfall traps and classified into feeding guilds and body-size classes. Insects and mammals were the main pest predators, and predation increased in summer but did not differ among habitats. Seed predation rates for both species were significantly higher in summer. Predation upon Taraxacum seeds was higher in the field interiors, whereas the predation rate upon Stellaria seeds was significantly higher in the field interiors and defects compared to that in the crop-defect boundaries. The predation rate by insects increased with the activity-density of the medium- and large-sized carnivorous carabids, whereas the seed predation rate for both weed species was positively related to the activity-density of medium-sized herbivorous carabids. Finally, the mean and maximum temperatures were negatively linked to the predation rates on artificial caterpillars and seeds of Taraxacum, respectively. Our results suggest that these ephemeral habitats are not related to a strong decrease in ecosystem services; thus, field defects may not cause substantial changes in ES provisioning. We confirmed that ground beetles are important providers of both investigated ESs and showed that microclimatic conditions might play an important role in the regulation of ESs in agroecosystems.},

Pardosa tuoba is active throughout the year in coastal prairie and scrub habitats where it feeds on terrestrial insects, while P. ramulosa is a specialist on aquatic insects and requires open water to feed. Because the availability of open water is somewhat unpredictable in Northern California, P. ramulosa has a less predictable habitat than P. tuoba. P. ramulosa was found to have the higher ballooning frequency, as predicted by the hypothesis.

  abstract  = {(1) Land‐use intensification in agricultural landscapes has led to changes in the way habitats and resources are distributed in space. Pests and their natural enemies are influenced by these changes, and by the farming intensity of crop fields. However, it is unknown whether the composition of landscapes (amount and diversity of land cover types) or their configuration (spatial arrangement of cover types) are more important for natural enemy diversity, and how they impact crop damage and yields. In addition, effects of interactions between local farming practices (organic vs. conventional) and landscape variables are unclear. 
(2) Here, we make use of a data set where landscape composition and configuration were uncorrelated across multiple spatial scales. Natural enemies, crop damage, and yields were sampled in 35 organic and conventional crop fields. Out of seven broad natural enemy taxa, five were positively affected by a complex landscape configuration. In contrast, only carabids were positively affected by the amount of seminatural habitat around fields. Increasing diversity of land cover types had positive effects on some, but negative effects on other taxa. Effect sizes varied among taxa but increased with increasing spatial scale, defined by circular areas of increasing radius around fields. 
(3) The diversity of aerial, but not of ground‐dwelling enemies was higher in fields under organic than conventional management. Interactions of local and landscape variables were important for birds, but not other enemies. Bird richness was higher in organic fields in simple landscapes, but not in landscapes with complex configuration or high land cover diversity. 
(4) Crop damage decreased with landscape diversity, but increased in conventional fields with complex configuration. Yields increased with both parameters in conventional fields only, and were higher on average in organic compared to conventional fields. Enemy diversity was positively related to crop damage, indicating positive density‐dependence of enemies on pests. However, the diversity of aerial enemies was also positively related to yields. 
(5) Our results suggest that the effectiveness of agri‐environmental schemes for managing natural enemy diversity, crop damage and yields could be enhanced by optimizing the effects of distinct landscape parameters, particularly landscape configuration and diversity, across scales.},

- Carabids in field defects, temporary non-crop habitats, were studied in oilseed rape fields.
- Mean carabid species richness was 26 % lower in defects compared to field interiors.
- Carabid activity-density was reduced by more than 50 % in field defects.
- Vegetation cover in field defects increased species richness of ground beetles.
- Re-sowing field defects or maintaining spontaneous weeds there can support carabids.

Landscape heterogeneity and higher complexity generally increase biodiversity in agroecosystems. Carabid beetles represent abundant and important predators of pests and weed seeds in temperate agroecosystems and are affected by landscape structure. Several studies have described the impact of permanent non-crop habitats such as woodlots, hedgerows, and grassy margins on carabid assemblages. However, temporal non-crop habitat islands within arable fields have been rarely investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate spatial distribution of carabid beetles within oilseed rape fields having temporary non-crop habitats (field defects). Field defects are areas where sown plants poorly develop due to sowing failures or extreme local conditions (soil humidity, missing nutrients). In twenty oilseed rape fields, we studied carabid assemblages collected with pitfall traps in three habitat types (field interiors, field defects, and boundaries between them) and in two sampling periods (spring and summer). Both activity-density and species richness were lower in field defects than in boundaries and field interiors during both sampling periods, indicating that field defects were not a preferred habitat for carabids. Activity-density and species richness significantly increased from spring to summer in all habitat types. Species composition of carabid assemblages significantly differed between field defects and field interiors or boundaries. Field defects were characterised by impoverished carabid assemblages and the presence of few indicator species. Interestingly, field defects with well-developed plant cover hosted carabid assemblages with species richness comparable to field interiors, indicating that re-sowing of field defects can support carabid populations within arable fields. However, the consequences of re-sowing on other arthropod taxa, e.g., insects requiring habitats with bare ground, and on populations of rare weeds need to be evaluated. The lack of effects of field defect size on carabid assemblages indicated that carabid beetles react to even very small patches with unsuitable conditions (e.g., very low humidity, high temperature or food scarcity).},

2. The few existing pollination recommendations focus on a particular number of honeybee or bumblebee hives per crop area, but these guidelines do not accurately predict the actual pollination services that crops receive.
3. We argue that pollination management for pollinator‐dependent crops should be based on direct measures of pollinator activity. We describe a protocol to quickly perform such a task by monitoring flower visitation rates.
4. We provide target values of visitation rates for crop yield maximization for several important crops by considering the number of visits per flower needed to ensure full ovule fertilization. If visitation rates are well below or above these target values, corrective measures should be taken.
5. Detailed additional data on visitation rates for different species, morpho‐species, or groups of species and/or flower‐visitor richness can improve pollination estimates.
6. Synthesis and applications. We present target values of visitation rates for some globally important pollinator‐dependent crops and provide guidance on why monitoring the number and diversity of pollinators is important, and how this information can be used for decision‐making. The implementation of flower monitoring programmes will improve management in many aspects, including enhanced quality and quantity of crop yield and a more limited spillover of managed (often exotic) pollinators from crop areas into native habitats, reducing their many potential negative impacts.},

The sample‐size‐ and coverage‐based integrations of rarefaction (interpolation) and extrapolation (prediction) of Hill numbers represent a unified standardization method for quantifying and comparing species diversity across multiple assemblages.
2. We briefly review the conceptual background of Hill numbers along with two approaches to standardization. We present an R package iNEXT (iNterpolation/EXTrapolation) which provides simple functions to compute and plot the seamless rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves for the three most widely used members of the Hill number family (species richness, Shannon diversity and Simpson diversity). Two types of biodiversity data are allowed: individual‐based abundance data and sampling‐unit‐based incidence data.
3. Several applications of the iNEXT packages are reviewed: (i) Non‐asymptotic analysis: comparison of diversity estimates for equally large or equally complete samples. (ii) Asymptotic analysis: comparison of estimated asymptotic or true diversities. (iii) Assessment of sample completeness (sample coverage) across multiple samples. (iv) Comparison of estimated point diversities for a specified sample size or a specified level of sample coverage.
4. Two examples are demonstrated, using the data (one for abundance data and the other for incidence data) included in the package, to illustrate all R functions and graphical displays.},

  abstract  = {1. Production of many flowering crops often benefits from elevated pollinator diversity and abundance. Nevertheless, the opposite relationship may arise if bees impair fruit or seed production and/or quality by damaging flowers during visitation, despite transferring pollen.
2. We assessed pollination and drupelet set (i.e. the number of drupelets per fruit) in 16 raspberry Rubus idaeus fields along a gradient of bee abundance in north‐west Patagonia, Argentina. Using pollen supplementation, we also tested whether drupelet set was pollen limited in a subset of six fields.
3. Managed Apis mellifera and the invasive bumblebee Bombus terrestris accounted for 50% and 45% of all bee visits, respectively, to raspberry flowers. Pollen loads on stigmas increased with visit frequency of all bees combined and particularly with visitation by A. mellifera, but not by B. terrestris. Drupelet set was not pollen limited along the gradient of bee abundance.
4. Instead, drupelet set decreased with the proportion of damaged styles, which varied more strongly with the frequency of visits by B. terrestris than by A. mellifera. In fields with the highest bee frequency of visits (~300 visits flower−1 day−1), ~80% of styles were damaged in flowers and these developed into fruits with ~30% fewer drupelets compared to flowers in fields with the lowest bee visitation rates (~4 visits flower−1 day−1).
5. Synthesis and applications. Extreme bee visitation, particularly by Bombus terrestris, damaged the styles of raspberry flowers, precluding ovule fertilization by deposited pollen and limiting crop production by reducing drupelet set. Only a few bee visits are required to maximize fruit production in raspberry plants, therefore, pollinator management in north‐west Patagonia should focus principally on reducing the abundance of the invasive bumblebee B. terrestris and secondarily controlling the number of honeybee hives in nearby cultivated fields. Although mainstream pollinator management relies on the assumption that more visits enhance fruit set, high bee visitation rates can be detrimental for fruit development and, consequently, for crop yield.},

  abstract  = {The act of converting prairie grassland to agricultural farmland has negative implications for pollinator communities. In the Prairie Pothole Region, wetland remnants are a common feature in intensively cultivated landscapes. These wetlands are typically small and often left embedded in the cropland matrix and may act as the only semi-natural feature in a radius of several hundred metres. To quantify the role that these in-field wetlands play in supporting native pollinators, we sampled bees at three distances from the wetland margin into the surrounding cropland (0 m, 25 m and 75 m) across the season in three field types (canola, cereal and perennial grassland). We used Bayesian multilevel models to test the hypothesis that native bees are using infield wetlands as habitat for nesting and foraging. Native bee abundance and diversity decreased further away from the margin of wetlands in both canola and cereal fields, while it increased in wetlands located in perennial grassland. Community composition did not change further away from wetlands, which may be because the foraging range of most species was within the sampling distance of the study. These results suggest that wetlands play an important role in providing critical resources for native pollinators, and encouraging farmers not to drain or plow through these wetlands will have beneficial impacts for native pollinators in the area. Maintaining in-field wetlands may have additional pollination benefits for farmers growing crops such as canola, which is known to benefit from insect visitors.},

  abstract  = {Agricultural intensification is a widespread driver of global pollinator decline that subsequently threatens the associated provisioning of ecosystem services. In North America's Prairie Pothole Region, wetlands surrounded by grassland were once abundant on the landscape, but now generally exist within a matrix of agriculture. We assessed whether restoration of these grassland-wetland complexes from cropland could be used as a potential tool for mitigating wild bee decline, using a 25-year restoration chronosequence. We also monitored the development of bee nesting and food resources to better establish the mechanisms that drive return to a restored habitat. Our objective was to assess whether restoration of grassland-wetland complexes can return bee communities to a reference state (i.e. remnant native grassland-wetland habitats), and to ascertain the timeline over which these changes occur. We found bee diversity increased following restoration and approximated reference sites after 1–4 years, while the diversity of non-Bombus species analyzed separately resembled reference sites after around 5–10 years. Floral diversity also increased following restoration from cropland but remained slightly lower than reference sites through time. Changes to bee species composition were driven more by floral species composition than time since restoration. Our results suggest that restored grassland-wetland complexes are able to provide food and nesting resources to bees within agriculturally dominated landscapes, and that restoration can recover wild bee communities to a reference state. On a broader scale, they underscore the utility of retaining patches of non-cropped and restored land within agroecosystems as a pathway for mitigating pollinator decline.},

Here we show that, to provide crop pollination in natural systems, the number of bee species must increase by at least one order of magnitude compared with that in field experiments.

In this paper we develop a mechanistic model to investigate under which circumstances interspecific differences in the tradeoff between foraging efficiency and travel costs can allow two central place foraging species to coexist in spite of considerable overlap in resource use. One species (Flyer) has a high basal metabolic rate, but a low relative cost of travelling such that it can use patches at a greater distance from its central place while the minimum patch quality it can economically use is high. The other species (Forager), by contrast, has a lower basal metabolic rate, but higher relative cost of travelling, and can therefore be a more efficient forager and able to use foraging patches of low quality, as long as they are not too far from the nest. We demonstrate that the coexistence of these two species critically depends on landscape composition and structure, with the Flyer outcompeting the Forager in structurally simple, coarse-grained, landscapes with abundant high-quality forage and the Forager outcompeting the Flyer in fine-grained highly diverse landscapes. Coexistence between the two species is possible when the landscape is structurally and compositionally complex, fine-grained, and has both high and low quality forage. Our results demonstrate that exploitative competition between two contrasting life histories can produce very different community dynamics depending on landscape composition and structure.},

Surprisingly, attempts to quantify the benefits of this encoded spatial information have failed to find positive effects on colony foraging success under many ecological circumstances. Experimental designs have often involved measuring the foraging success of colonies that were repeatedly switched between oriented dances versus disoriented dances (i.e. communicating vectors versus not communicating vectors). However, if recruited bees continue to visit profitable food sources for more than one day, this procedure would lead to confounded results because of the long-term effects of successful recruitment events. Using agent-based simulations, we found that spatial information was beneficial in almost all ecological situations. Contrary to common belief, the benefits of recruitment increased with environmental stability because benefits can accumulate over time to outweigh the short-term costs of recruitment. Furthermore, we found that in simulations mimicking previous experiments, the benefits of communication were considerably underestimated (at low food density) or not detected at all (at medium and high densities). Our results suggest that the benefits of waggle dance communication are currently underestimated and that different experimental designs, which account for potential long-term benefits, are needed to measure empirically how spatial information affects colony foraging success.},

These secretions are referred to as scent-marks, which bumblebees are able to use as social cues. Although it has been found that bumblebees can detect and associate scent-marks with rewarding or unrewarding flowers, their ability at discriminating between scent-marks from bumblebees of differing relatedness is unknown. We performed three separate experiments with bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), where they were repeatedly exposed to rewarding and unrewarding artificial flowers simultaneously. Each flower type carried scent-marks from conspecifics of differing relatedness or were unmarked. We found that bumblebees are able to distinguish between 1. Unmarked flowers and flowers that they themselves had scent-marked, 2. Flowers scent-marked by themselves and flowers scent-marked by others in their nest (nestmates), and 3. Flowers scent-marked by their nestmates and flowers scent-marked by non-nestmates. The bumblebees found it more difficult to discriminate between each of the flower types when both flower types were scent-marked. Our findings show that bumblebees have the ability to discriminate between scent-marks of conspecifics, which are potentially very similar in their chemical composition, and they can use this ability to improve their foraging success.},

Meeting future food demands for 9 billion people in the next 30 years will require either agricultural expansion or intensification to increase production. However, agriculture is already a major driver of biodiversity loss, as well as freshwater withdrawals, nutrient inputs, and greenhouse gasses, among other pressing environmental issues. In this paper, we look for solutions to this production-conservation challenge at the subfield scale. We use precision agriculture yield data from three farms in Southern Ontario and convert them into “profit maps” that show which regions of a field have management costs that exceed the market value of the commodities produced. We analyse the profit of three farms over time and identify areas that consistently show low or negative profit and thus constitute a compelling case for taking these areas out of production. We find, for example, that up to 14% of farmland can result in money loss and even more than 50% of the land might still not meet minimum revenue expectations. Further, we assess the economic feasibility of conservation strategies on these set-aside lands and find that investing in environmental benefits (even minimally) can often times be inexpensive when compared with economic losses due to failed harvests. We argue that profit mapping can serve as a management tool for farmers that will allow them to identify optimal crop areas, optimize nutrient inputs, plan for ecological intensification, and avoid economic loss all while providing ecosystem services at the local scale.},

Two levels of yield data quality included standard output where the default settings of farm-level mapping software were accepted and where filtering of the data was undertaken. Results indicated that yield data quality affects farm management decisions.

- We quantify the impact of hedgerows and grass strips on a range of ecosystem services
- We describe multifunctionality and trade-offs on parcel level
- The trade-off between crop yield and other ecosystem services is context specific.

In north western Europe, agricultural systems are generally managed to maximize the potential delivery of provisioning ecosystem services. This has often been at the expense of other ecosystem services. Because the current supply of most ecosystem services is insufficient to meet the increasing demand, particular attention to ecosystem service delivery and hence multifunctionality in agriculture is vital. In this paper, we quantitatively assessed the impact of hedgerows and grass strips bordering parcels with annual arable crops on the simultaneous delivery of a set of ecosystem services and from there we identified synergies and trade-offs on virtual parcels. After a systematic literature search, mixed models were applied on observations from 60 studies and quantitative effect relationships between ecosystem service delivery and hedgerow and grass strip characteristics were developed. Next to the hedgerow, until a distance of twice the hedgerow height, arable crop yield was reduced by 29%. Beyond this distance, until 20 times the hedgerow height, crop yield was increased by 6%. Compared to a similar arable parcel without hedgerow or grass strip, soil carbon stock was 22% higher in the hedgerow, on average 6% higher in the adjacent parcel next to the hedgerow and 37% higher in the upper 30 cm soil layer in the grass strip. Both hedgerows and grass strips intercepted nitrogen from the surface (69% and 67%, respectively) and subsurface (34% and 32%, respectively) flow and phosphorus (67% and 73%, respectively) and soil sediment (91% and 90%, respectively) from the surface flow. More natural predator species were found on parcels with hedgerows, but the number of predators was unaffected. On parcels with grass strips, both predator density and diversity was higher and aphid density was reduced. Our calculations on parcel level indicate that the trade-off between arable crop yield and regulating ecosystem services depends on hedgerow width and height and parcel dimensions. A similar trade-off is found on parcels with grass strips, but increasing grass strip width results in a proportionally higher delivery of regulating ecosystem services.},

  abstract  = {Conversion of wetlands in cultivated agricultural landscapes is one of the primary drivers of wetland loss in Alberta, Canada, despite a provincial wetland policy that prioritizes wetland avoidance. While other sectors of the agricultural industry have established initiatives to maintain wetlands, a common narrative within the conventional cropping sector is that wetland retention leads to lost acreage and overlap of crop inputs, and that there are financial benefits associated with wetland drainage. The objective of this research was to explicitly quantify crop productivity within drained wetland basins, in an effort to better understand the extent to which producers financially benefit from drainage practices. Working collaboratively with canola producers in central Alberta over the 2019 growing season, wetland basins within four quarter sections were mapped using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, and wetland basins with clear evidence of surface drainage were identified. Agricultural input and yield data provided by producers was then used to quantify profitability within each drained basin. Average profit for drained basins for each producer ranged between -$145/acre and $76/acre, with an average of $55/acre across all operations. This is compared to an average profit of $203/acre for non-wetland areas across all operations. The results suggest that the financial benefits of drainage are highly variable, and for many drained basins, producers may experience financial losses that may be overlooked when profits are examined only at the field- or operation-level. While this study included a small number of operations, and was limited to one type of crop over a single growing season, the results still provide important insight into the extent to which producers benefit financially from the practice of wetland drainage.},

- Landscape cover influences predatory arthropod abundance in agricultural landscapes.
- Spiders and ground beetles migrate into canola crops during the early summer.
- Grasslands and wetlands act as reservoir habitat between seasons.
- Farmers should consider preserving habitat around fields in order to suppress pests.

Ground-dwelling arthropods can be important generalist predators in agroecosystems, and can use non-crop features as overwintering habitats. However, it is unclear which types of landscape features constitute useful non-crop habitat, and at what spatial scale organisms gather resources. Additionally, the same landscape feature may act as a source or a destination for arthropods at different times of the year, but this is rarely considered. We modeled the abundance of four common species of Canadian prairie arthropods caught in a set of 198 in-field and roadside pitfall traps (June to August of 2017). Functional regression was used in order to simultaneously consider both the habitat preferences and the timing of movement from the land cover classes. Pterostichus melanarius (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and Pardosa moesta (Araneae: Lycosidae) were attracted to canola (Brassica napus) during the early summer, then dispersed to grasslands, wetlands, and grassy road margins at the end of the summer. In particular, Pterostichus melanarius aggregated in canola early in the growing season, suggesting that its role in suppressing crop pests may be underestimated. Pardosa distincta (Araneae: Lycosidae) and Phalangium opilio (Opiliones: Opilionidae) showed weak patterns of seasonal migration, and were more influenced by large-scale geographic patterns rather than landscape composition. Our results suggest that predatory arthropods may migrate into canola crops during the early summer, and that grasslands and wetlands may act as seasonal reservoir habitats. Farmers and land managers should consider preserving existing habitat in order to maintain pest-control services across the season.},

  abstract  = {- Conventional intensification of agriculture has reduced the availability of resources for pollinators, reducing their diversity and affecting plant pollination, both in natural habitats and croplands. Field margin floral enhancements such as flower strips or restored field margins could counteract these negative effects.
- The approaches to assess the success of these management measures generally evaluate separately the pollinator response at the edge and within the crop, as proxies for pollinator conservation and pollination services, respectively.
- We performed a meta-analysis to understand the influence of field margin floral enhancements on the abundance and richness of pollinators at the edge and within the field, and on crop yield.
- We estimated 137 effect sizes from 40 studies, all from the northern hemisphere. Overall, the field margin floral enhancements increased the abundance and richness of pollinators at the field edge but had no consistent effect in the interior of the crop fields. Few studies evaluated crop yield, and in these studies no effects were observed.
- These results suggest that field margin floral enhancements can constitute a positive conservation action for pollinators but not necessarily associated with pollination ecosystem service.},

  abstract  = {Human land use, through forest management and conversion of natural habitats into agroecosystems, has often resulted in loss of biodiversity. Spiders are important predators in terrestrial ecosystems, biological control agents against pests in agroecosystems and forests, and useful indicators due to their sensibility to changes in habitat structure and microclimate. Effects of land use on spiders have been reviewed several times but existing reviews are narrative and usually focused on one single kind of management. We summarize the impacts of land use on spider abundance and species richness using meta-analysis. The main ecosystems where the effect of management on spiders has been studied were forests, agroecosystems and rangelands (including meadows and grasslands). Although our survey retrieved studies from all parts of the world and climatic zones, a dominance of studies from temperate habitats in Europe and North America was evident. The meta-analysis showed negative effects on spider species richness and abundance for agroecosystems and rangelands, but were less evident for forests. From 10 kinds of land management identified, all but forest plantation showed effects on spider richness or abundance. These land management scenarios affected either species richness (forest fragmentation and logging, farmland abandonment, and miscellaneous management including plowing, cutting and fire), or spider abundance (forest fragmentation, forest fire, conventional farming, insecticides, grazing, and farmland abandonment), but not both. Edge effects had contrasting effects depending on the ecosystem, affecting spider species richness in agroecosystems and abundance in rangelands and forests. Direct destruction of spiders or negative effects on habitat heterogeneity or prey populations were the most likely causes of the negative effects detected.},

  pages     = {107290},

  abstract  = {Highlights
- We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 54 studies.
- Field-edge flower plantings consistently increased pollinator richness and abundance in field edges and became more effective as they matured.
- The influence of field-edge plantings on crop pollination and yield was inconsistent.
- Factors such as landscape context and crop type may influence when plantings are effective.
- Defining how plantings impact pollinator population growth would help clarify how they impact on crop pollination and pollinator conservation.

Planting flowers along crop field edges is an increasingly common management strategy for addressing pollinator declines and improving crop pollination. However, few reviews have been published summarizing the efficacy of this specific management practice and how it impacts ecosystem service delivery to crops. We conducted a systematic review (54 studies) and meta-analysis (4–29 studies, depending on the response) to determine whether such plantings 1) increase pollinator abundance or richness within field edges, 2) increase the abundance or richness of pollinators visiting crop flowers, or 3) improve crop yields. Our review and meta-analysis suggest that field-edge flower plantings are highly effective at increasing pollinator richness and abundance in field edges and that plantings become more effective as they mature. However, the influence of field-edge plantings on crop pollination and yield is inconsistent. Planting size and richness did not change these results. While this analysis shows that field-edge flower plantings consistently increase pollinator abundance and richness, there remain critical gaps in our knowledge of when and how plantings can improve ecosystem service provision and delivery. Determining if field-edge plantings affect pollinator population growth may clarify how plantings improve crop pollination, while further research on landscape context and crop type may define when this happens.},

  title     = {Field boundary features can stabilise bee populations and the pollination of mass-flowering crops in rotational systems},
  year      = {2021},
  volume    = {In press},
  abstract  = {1. Pollinators experience large spatio-temporal fluctuations in resource availability when mass-flowering crops are rotated with resource-poor cereal crops. Yet, few studies have considered the effect this has on pollinator population stability, nor how this might be mitigated to maintain consistent crop pollination services.

2. We assess the potential of boundary features (standard narrow 1m grassy margins, hedgerows and wide 4m agri-environment margins) to support and stabilise pollinator populations and pollination service in agricultural landscapes under crop rotation. Assuming a six-year rotation, we use a process-based pollinator model to predict yearly pollinator population size and in-crop visitation rates to oilseed rape and field bean across 117 study landscapes in England with varying amounts of boundary features. We model both ground-nesting bumblebees and solitary bees and compare the predictions including and excluding boundary features from the landscapes.

3. Ground-nesting bumblebee populations, whose longer-lifetime colonies benefit from continuity of resources, were larger and more stable (relative to the no-features scenario) in landscapes with more boundary features. Ground-nesting solitary bee populations were also larger but not significantly more stable, except with the introduction of wide permanent agri-environment margins, due to their shorter lifetimes and shorter foraging/dispersal ranges.

4. Crop visitation by ground-nesting bumblebees was greater and more stable in landscapes with more boundary features, partly due to increased colony growth prior to crop flowering. Time-averaged crop visitation by ground-nesting solitary bees was slightly lower, due to females dividing their foraging time between boundary features and the crop, but the more stable delivery compensated for this by nonetheless increasing the minimum pollination service delivered in any given year.

5. Synthesis and applications. Field boundary features have an important role in stabilising pollinator populations and pollination service in rotational systems, although maintenance of larger semi-natural habitat patches may be more effective for stabilising less mobile solitary bee populations. We recommend using combinations of boundary features, accounting for pollinator range when spacing features/rotating crops, and synchronising boundary feature management with crop rotation to maximise their stabilising benefits.},

However, it remains unknown to what extent biodiversity can be enhanced by altering landscape pattern without reducing agricultural production. We propose a framework for this problem, considering separately compositional heterogeneity (the number and proportions of different cover types) and configurational heterogeneity (the spatial arrangement of cover types). Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of ‘functional landscape heterogeneity’. We then identify three important questions: does biodiversity increase with (1) increasing heterogeneity of the more-natural areas, (2) increasing compositional heterogeneity of production cover types and (3) increasing configurational heterogeneity of production cover types? We discuss approaches for addressing these questions. Such studies should have high priority because biodiversity protection globally depends increasingly on maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.},

  abstract  = {Hedgerows are important features within urban, peri-urban, and agricultural habitats because they shelter most of the biodiversity in a landscape dominated by infrastructures or a monoculture. Hedges are characterized by their vegetative cover but also by their base, notably the breadth of the embankment and the various microhabitats made by stones, coarse woody debris, and leaf litter. These features determine the availabilities of arboreal and ground refuges. Their respective roles on biodiversity remain poorly explored. We experimentally manipulated the size of the embankment in newly-constructed hedges in a peri-urban context. We used non-lethal rapid biodiversity assessments and functional indices (accounting for body mass, trophic level, and metabolic mode) to monitor the presence of a wide range of animal taxa. We observed a positive effect of embankment size on animal biodiversity. Various elements of the fauna (e.g. arthropods, reptiles) rapidly colonized newly-constructed hedges provided with an embankment. Guidelines to restore hedgerows should consider embankment size and quality. Both of these features can be improved by simply retaining the materials that are extracted when establishing agricultural plots such that a diversity of microhabitats and ground refuges become available.},

  abstract  = {Hedgerows play important roles in agricultural landscapes and they increase biodiversity by providing habitat refugia for species sensitive to agricultural disturbance. We have studied the characteristics of the communities of harvestmen (Opiliones) inhabiting hedgerows. Harvestmen are terrestrial arachnids associated with soil surface and subsurface and sensitive to land-use and disturbance. We were specifically interested in quantifying how hedgerow characteristics (e.g., elevation, length, width, connectivity, and plant diversity) affect harvestman diversity and community composition. We expected harvestman diversity and community composition to be positively related to both hedgerow size (area, length, width) and biological attributes of hedgerows (e.g., connectivity, plant community diversity). We surveyed hedgerow characteristics and harvestman communities of 20 hedgerows in an upland agricultural landscape in the Western Carpathians. Hedgerow characteristics were measured in the field or derived from GIS layers and we used correlation and ordination methods to relate them to harvestman community metrics. We found surprisingly high taxonomic richness of harvestmen within the studied hedgerows (15 species). Importantly, the Shannon index of harvestman communities was positively related to hedgerow length and hedgerow tree layer species richness and diversity. Harvestman community composition varied with hedgerow area and width. Despite their small total area, hedgerows represented an important habitat for diverse harvestman communities and hedgerow attributes such as size and tree diversity significantly affected the composition and the Shannon index of harvestman communities. Thus, greater lengths and widths of hedgerows can provide habitats for a higher Shannon index of harvestman communities, within surrounding agricultural landscapes.},

The importance of shelterbelt plant diversity for birds was investigated by a survey of 62 sites in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia. An area search technique was used to assess bird occurrence. An all subsets and exponential regression analysis approach explored the relationships between woody plant diversity and avifauna diversity (using Hill’s diversity index), whilst seasonal variations were analysed using restricted maximum likelihood. Sixty-six bird species, including many that are woodland-dependent, representing eight foraging guilds, were observed in the shelterbelts. More species of birds occurred and at higher density in more floristically diverse shelterbelts. Other factors found to influence avifaunal use of shelterbelts were woody plant density, shelterbelt width, structural complexity, tree height, crown cover index and elevation. Seasonal analysis confirmed the importance of these independent variables but also revealed the significance of shelterbelt’s proximity to water during summer for birds using this habitat. This study shows that floristic diversity, amongst other factors, is a significant predictor of avifauna diversity in shelterbelts and suggests that shelterbelts may be designed to optimize their wildlife habitat and biodiversity conservation values.},

We use data from 315 transects, completed as part of a national acoustic survey of bat distribution, to examine the incidence of four bat species adjacent to linear features in rural areas. The use of linear features was assessed in relation to hedgerow width, tree density, the presence of water and woodland proximity. To examine the effect of tree density, linear features were classified as either hedgerows without trees, hedgerows with sparse trees (comprising <50% tree canopy) or tree-lines (>50% tree canopy). The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pipstrellus was not affected by tree density; linear features of all types were associated with a similar increase in P. pipistrellus incidence. The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pygmaeus was dependent on both tree density and the proximity of woodland; only linear features containing trees provided an increase in P. pygmaeus incidence regardless of woodland proximity. P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus incidence was not affected by hedgerow width or the presence of water. Incidence of Nyctalus noctula and Eptesicus serotinus was unaffected by the density of linear features of any type. Many agri-environment schemes offer financial incentives for the creation and management of hedgerows. Optimising the biodiversity gain provided by linear features will maximise the effectiveness of these schemes. Agri-environment measures that encourage the provision and retention of hedgerow trees will benefit bats in agricultural landscapes.},

  abstract  = {Semi-natural habitats (SNH) maintain high levels of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning within agroecosystems. While management recommendations for SNH to promote biodiversity and optimize natural pest control, have mostly focused on improving food resources for predators, overwintering conditions have hitherto received less attention. The success of conservation biological control is often hampered by a lack of knowledge on how different habitats and their associated traits drive the overwintering of both, crop pests and their natural enemies. Moreover, there are concerns that SNH may act as reservoirs for crop pests.

We investigated the overwintering of pollen beetles (Meligethes spp.) and their predators (predatory ground beetles) across 40 habitats of all major types of SNH as well as 8 winter oilseed rape (WOSR) fields, to identify the importance of type and key traits of habitats. Overwintering of pollen beetles was higher in WOSR fields (7 individuals per 0.25 m2) and forest edges (4) compared to flower strips (2) or forest interiors (1). Similarly, overwintering of predatory ground beetles was higher in forest edges and WOSR fields (11 and 10 individuals, respectively) than in flower strips, meadows or hedgerows (4, 4 and 2 individuals). The predator-prey ratio (number of predatory ground beetles / number of pollen beetles) was higher in forest edges than in flower strips, meadows or hedgerows, and intermediate in WOSR fields. Pollen beetle numbers were negatively associated with increasing litter cover and positively with increasing bare soil, while predatory ground beetles were positively associated with soil bulk density and bare soil cover. The proportion of SNH at the landscape level (1 km radius) did not affect overwintering pollen beetles, predatory ground beetles or predator-prey ratio.

We conclude that WOSR fields, rather than SNH are the major overwintering habitat and source of spring colonisation of WOSR by pollen beetles. Forest edges promote predatory ground beetles rather than pollen beetle populations according to their disproportionally high value of overwintering individuals. Agri-environmental measures to promote predatory ground beetles rather than pollen beetles should promote overwintering habitats with compact soils and high litter cover.},

However, in some tropical agricultural systems, conserving natural habitat can simultaneously protect threatened species and support important ecosystem services. Oil palm cultivation is expanding rapidly throughout the tropics but the extent to which non-crop habitat supports biodiversity and ecosystem services in these landscapes is poorly documented. We investigated whether riparian forest fragments (riparian reserves) provide a pest control service or increase pest activity (disservice) within oil palm dominated landscapes in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We assessed the activity of potential predators of pest herbivores using plasticine caterpillar mimics and quantified herbivory rates on oil palm fronds in areas with and without riparian reserves. We also manipulated the shape and colour of the mimics to assess the extent to which artificial pest mimics reflect a predatory response. The presence of riparian reserves increased the attack rate on mimics by arthropods, but not by birds. Our methodological study suggested attacks on artificial pest mimics provide a better indication of predatory activity for birds than for arthropod predators. Herbivory rates were also not significantly affected by the presence of a riparian reserve, but we found some evidence that herbivory rates may decrease as the size of riparian reserves increases. Overall, we conclude that riparian forest fragments of 30 – 50 m width on each side of the river are unlikely to provide a pest control service. Nevertheless, our results provide evidence that these riparian buffer strips do not increase the density of defoliating pests, which should reassure managers concerned about possible negative consequences of preserving riparian buffers.},

  abstract     = {An ever-expanding human population, ongoing global climatic changes, and the spread of intensive farming practices is putting increasing pressure on agroecosystems and the inherent biodiversity they contain. Non-production vegetation elements, such as woody patches, riparian margins, and inter-crop and restoration plantings, are vital for conserving biodiversity in agroecosystems and are therefore considered key to sustaining the biotic and abiotic processes underpinning sustainable and resilient agroecosystems. Despite this critical role, there is a surprising lack of synthesis of which types of non-production vegetation elements drive and/or support ecological processes and the mechanisms by which this occurs. Using a systematic, quantitative literature review of 342 articles, we asked: what are the effects of non-production vegetation elements on agroecosystem processes and how are these processes measured within global agroecosystems? Our literature search focussed on the effects of non-production vegetation related to faunal, weed, disease, and abiotic processes. The majority (61\%) of studies showed positive effects on ecological processes: non-production vegetation increased the presence, level or rate of the studied process. However, rather than directly measuring ecosystem processes, 83\% of studies inferred processes using proxies for ecosystem function, such as biodiversity and soil physicochemical properties. Studies that directly measured non-production vegetation effects focussed on a limited number of vegetation effects including comparisons of vegetation types, farm-scale configuration, and proximity to vegetation. Moreover, studies directly measuring ecosystem processes were similarly limited, dominated by invertebrate biocontrol, predator and natural enemy spillover, animal movement, and ecosystem cycling. We identify research gaps and present a pathway for future research in understanding the ecosystem components and processes that build resilient, sustainable agroecosystems.},

  abstract = {Windbreaks are key structural elements in the rural environment and affect the functionality of landscapes in multiple ways. A broad interdisciplinary view on these functions lacks in scientific literature and common knowledge. This led to underinformed management decisions, a decrease in the number of windbreaks in wide areas, and a subsequent loss of landscape functionality. Therefore, the knowledge on windbreaks and associated ecosystem services (ES) was systematically reviewed to guide the way for a holistic comprehension of such structural landscape elements. We defined eight bundles of ES on the basis of the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services scheme. Search terms that allowed to include only vegetative windbreaks consisting of at least one tree row were combined with appropriate search terms for the eight ES bundles in individual searches resulting in a total of 6,094 hits. We considered only publications that provided quantitative data and allowed to derive a clear effect of windbreaks on ES so that 222 publications from all over the world were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. The outcomes provide information about the dimension of effort, scientific consensus or dissensus, and knowledge gaps in the different research disciplines involved. It was shown that windbreaks bring predominantly positive effects to landscapes in the course of all investigated ES bundles. Apparent positive effects were found for soil protection, biodiversity and pest control, whereas for biomass production, nutrient and water balance, also adverse or indifferent effects were reported. The present review reveals an intense need for further interdisciplinary research using indicators, ES approaches or similar instruments that enable quantitative and comparable statements about the functionality of windbreaks in rural landscapes.},

Three flower treatments were tested: 1) buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), 2) yellow mustard (Brassica hirta), 3) sweet alyssum (Lobularia maritima), and cucumbers as a control. Flowers were planted within a commercial cucumber field in 20-m-long strips in a randomized complete block design with six replications in the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. Some floral treatments successfully attracted more beneficial insects than others, but the beneficials did not disperse out to the cucumber plants. Cucumber yield was unaffected by flowers with one exception: in 2015, cucumber yield in the sweet alyssum plots were greater than those in plots with no flowers. Our research indicates that adding flowers to cucumber fields to increase services from beneficial insects needs to be further investigated to better understand the effect of factors such as relative flowering strip size.},

On a larger landscape scale windbreaks provide habitat for various types of wildlife and have the potential to contribute significant benefits to the carbon balance equation, easing the economic burdens associated with climate change. For a windbreak to function properly, it must be designed with the needs of the landowner in mind. The ability of a windbreak to meet a specific need is determined by its structure: both external structure, width, height, shape, and orientation as well as the internal structure; the amount and arrangement of the branches, leaves, and stems of the trees or shrubs in the windbreak. In response to windbreak structure, wind flow in the vicinity of a windbreak is altered and the microclimate in sheltered areas is changed; temperatures tend to be slightly higher and evaporation is reduced. These types of changes in microclimate can be utilized to enhance agricultural sustainability and profitability. While specific mechanisms of the shelter response remain unclear and are topics for further research, the two biggest challenges we face are: developing a better understanding of why producers are reluctant to adopt windbreak technology and defining the role of woody plants in the agricultural landscape.},

  abstract  = {Agroforestry (the integration of trees into agricultural landscapes) has been promoted, in Australia and elsewhere, as a way to increase farm productivity by providing a wide range of benefits. Despite this, adoption of agroforestry in Australian agricultural systems remains low. To implement agroforestry, farmers must be convinced the benefits of including trees outweigh the costs. This review evaluates the available quantitative data on shelter benefits with emphasis on Australian conditions, identifies key research gaps and determines if there is sufficient knowledge to make accurate predictions about impacts on farm productivity.

Availability of quantitative data on windbreak shelter benefits was examined in five key areas; water use and evaporation, crop/pasture production, livestock mortality, livestock productivity and the capacity to model impacts of windbreaks on crop/livestock systems. Good quantitative data exists for many areas, particularly for changes in environmental conditions following tree establishment, however there were many gaps in key areas. Importantly, the ability to predict crop growth under spatially and temporally variable environmental conditions and the impact of windbreaks on livestock productivity is not yet able to be meaningfully quantified. Thus modelling the profitability of windbreaks is difficult and existing models require additional quantitative data to validate and improve them.},

  abstract  = {For this article, I reviewed empirical studies finding significant ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se—in other words, significant responses to fragmentation independent of the effects of habitat amount (hereafter referred to as habitat fragmentation). I asked these two questions: Are most significant responses to habitat fragmentation negative or positive? And do particular attributes of species or landscapes lead to a predominance of negative or positive significant responses? I found 118 studies reporting 381 significant responses to habitat fragmentation independent of habitat amount. Of these responses, 76% were positive. Most significant fragmentation effects were positive, irrespective of how the authors controlled for habitat amount, the measure of fragmentation, the taxonomic group, the type of response variable, or the degree of specialization or conservation status of the species or species group. No support was found for predictions that most significant responses to fragmentation should be negative in the tropics, for species with larger movement ranges, or when habitat amount is low; most significant fragmentation effects were positive in all of these cases. Thus, although 24% of significant responses to habitat fragmentation were negative, I found no conditions in which most responses were negative. Authors suggest a wide range of possible explanations for significant positive responses to habitat fragmentation: increased functional connectivity, habitat diversity, positive edge effects, stability of predator–prey/host–parasitoid systems, reduced competition, spreading of risk, and landscape complementation. A consistent preponderance of positive significant responses to fragmentation implies that there is no justification for assigning lower conservation value to a small patch than to an equivalent area within a large patch—instead, it implies just the opposite. This finding also suggests that land sharing will usually provide higher ecological value than land sparing.},

- Habitat fragmentation per se is a landscape-scale phenomenon.
- Cross-scale extrapolation from edge effects to fragmentation effects is unreliable.
- Most responses to habitat fragmentation per se are non-significant.
- Most significant responses to habitat fragmentation per se are positive.
- Sets of small habitat patches with a large total area have high conservation value.


In a review of landscape-scale empirical studies, Fahrig (2017a) found that ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se (fragmentation independent of habitat amount) were usually non-significant (>70% of responses) and that 76% of significant relationships were positive, with species abundance, occurrence, richness, and other response variables increasing with habitat fragmentation per se. Fahrig concluded that to date there is no empirical evidence supporting the widespread assumption that a group of small habitat patches generally has lower ecological value than large patches of the same total area. Fletcher et al. (2018) dispute this conclusion, arguing that the literature to date indicates generally negative ecological effects of habitat fragmentation per se. They base their argument largely on extrapolation from patch-scale patterns and mechanisms (effects of patch size and isolation, and edge effects) to landscape-scale effects of habitat fragmentation. We argue that such extrapolation is unreliable because: (1) it ignores other mechanisms, especially those acting at landscape scales (e.g., increased habitat diversity, spreading of risk, landscape complementation) that can counteract effects of the documented patch-scale mechanisms; and (2) extrapolation of a small-scale mechanism to a large-scale pattern is not evidence of that pattern but, rather a prediction that must be tested at the larger scale. Such tests were the subject of Fahrig's review. We find no support for Fletcher et al.'s claim that biases in Fahrig's review would alter its conclusions. We encourage further landscape-scale empirical studies of effects of habitat fragmentation per se, and research aimed at uncovering the mechanisms that underlie positive fragmentation effects.},

  abstract = {1. Agricultural landscapes provide the essential ecosystem service of food to growing human populations; at the same time, agricultural expansion to increase crop production results in forest fragmentation, degrading many other forest-dependent ecosystem services. However, surprisingly little is known about the role that forest fragments play in the provision of ecosystem services and how fragmentation affects landscape multifunctionality at scales relevant to land management decisions.
2. We measured the provision of six ecosystem services (crop production, pest regulation, decomposition, carbon storage, soil fertility and water quality regulation) in soya bean fields at different distances from adjacent forest fragments that differed in isolation and size across an agricultural landscape in Quebec, Canada.
3. We observed significant effects of distance-from-forest, fragment isolation and fragment size on crop production, insect pest regulation, and decomposition.
4. Distance-from-forest and fragment isolation had unique influences on service provision for each of the ecosystem services we measured. For example, pest regulation was maximized adjacent to forest fragments, while crop production was maximized at intermediate distances-from-forest. As a consequence, landscape multifunctionality depended on landscape heterogeneity: the range of field and forest fragment types present.
5. We also observed strong negative and positive relationships between ecosystem services that were more prevalent at greater distances-from-forest.
6. Synthesis and applications. Our study is one of the first to empirically measure and model the effects of forest fragments on the simultaneous provision of multiple ecosystem services in an agro-ecosystem at the landscape and field scales relevant to landowners and managers. Our results demonstrate that forest fragments, irrespective of their size, can affect the provision of multiple ecosystem services in surrounding fields, but that this effect is mediated by fragment isolation across the landscape. Our results also suggest that managing habitat fragmentation and landscape structure will improve our ability to optimize ecosystem service provision and create multifunctional agricultural landscapes.},

2. We suggest “bright spots” as a promising tool to identify levers of change by finding areas that exceed expectations for goals, such as agricultural landscape multifunctionality and biodiversity.
3. We identified bright, dark and average spots within a complex agricultural landscape and explored the associated socioeconomic patterns. We found that areas exceeding expectations for biodiversity and landscape multifunctionality were neither spatially congruent nor in conflict. It was more common for areas to underperform (dark spots) for both biodiversity and multifunctionality than over perform for both (bright spots).
4. While dark spots for multifunctionality were alike in their ecosystem service composition, bright spots were bright in multiple, diverse ways. The socioeconomic attributes that characterize bright and darks spots included both farm characteristics as well as farming practices, suggesting that both have potential to be levers of change.
5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that while biodiversity and landscape multifunctionality show similar spatial patterns due to underlying biophysical drivers, managing for biodiversity or landscape multifunctionality alone will not implicitly achieve the other in this system. Bright spots (areas exceeding expectations) in multifunctionality were associated with many different combinations of ecosystem services, but dark spots were uniquely agricultural intensive areas devoted to maximizing crop production at the expense of all other services. From a management perspective, specific farm characteristics and farming practices may impact the potential for multifunctionality: increased mechanization, increased agricultural inputs and larger farm size and capital were associated with dark spots, while smaller farms with potentially greater space for innovation were associated with bright spots.},

  abstract  = {A range of policy initiatives have been promoted in recent years to address the decline of bee populations in Europe and North America. Among these has been the establishment of flower-rich habitat within or around intensively farmed landscapes to increase the availability of pollen and nectar resources. The composition of these habitats depends on location and compatibility with adjacent cropping systems, but they often consist of fields planted with temporary flowering cover crops, field borders with perennial or annual flowering species, hedgerows comprising prolifically flowering shrubs, and grass buffer strips (used to manage erosion and nutrient runoff) which are supplemented with dicotyledonous flower species. While the primary objective of such measures is to increase the ecological fitness of pollinator populations through enhanced larval and adult nutrition, such strategies also provide secondary benefits to the farm and the surrounding landscape. Specifically, the conservation of pollinator habitat can enhance overall biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides (including pest population reduction), protect soil and water quality by mitigating runoff and protecting against soil erosion, and enhance rural aesthetics. Incorporating these secondary benefits into decision making processes is likely to help stakeholders to assess the trade-offs implicit in supplying ecosystem services.},

Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma, showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing ‘yield gaps’ on underperforming lands, increasing cropping efficiency, shifting diets and reducing waste. Together, these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.},

The value of these yield maps can be compromised by the fact that raw yield maps contain a variety of inherent errors. Researchers have reported that 10 to 50% of the observations in a given field contain significant errors and should be removed. Methods for removing these outliers from raw yield data have not been standardized, although many different filtering techniques have been suggested to address specific error types. We developed a software tool called Yield Editor to simplify the process of applying filtering techniques for yield data outlier detection and removal. Yield Editor includes a map view of the yield data, allowing the user to interactively set, assess the effects of, and refine a number of previously reported automated filtering methods. Additionally, Yield Editor allows manual selection of erroneous points, transects, or regions for investigation and possible deletion. This paper describes the filters implemented in Yield Editor, discusses input, output, and filtering options, and documents availability of the program. Example applications of Yield Editor on five test fields are used to show how the user interacts with the software and to analyze the relative importance of the various filters.},

The algorithm was applied to four yield maps of maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr.] grown under irrigated and rainfed conditions. A total of 13 to 20% of the original yield monitor data was removed, with 72 to 85% of the removal occurring in the mandatory, primary screening process (Steps 1 and 2). Only 2.6 to 3.9% of the original yield monitor data were removed during secondary screening (Steps 3 through 6), but this additional screening lead to yield semivariograms with smaller nugget values and sills and a relative increase in map precision of 4.3 to 5.4% compared with conducting primary screening only. The local neighborhood outlier test (Step 5) removed a larger proportion of yield values in soybean (12.8 to 14.9% of all deleted values) than in maize (2.7 to 3.2%). The proposed algorithm is robust enough for implementation in commercial software but requires further testing in other crops and environments and with other brands of yield monitors.},

Apple quality at harvest was evaluated from samples of the two cultivars in both years for which fruit mass, flesh firmness, soluble solids content, juice pH and acidity of the juice were determined. The variation in tree flowering was also measured in the spring of the second season using a stereological sampling procedure. The results showed considerable variability in the number of tree flowers, yield and quality across the orchard for both cultivars. The number of flowers was strongly correlated with the final yield. These data could potentially be used to plan precise thinning and for early prediction of yield; the latter is important for marketing the fruit. Several quality characteristics, including fruit juice soluble solids content and acid content were negatively correlated with yield. The general patterns of spatial variation in several variables suggested that changes in topography and aspect had important effects on apple yield and quality.},

The local Moran’s index of spatial autocorrelation and Moran’s plot were used as tool to identify the spatial outliers. The protocol to filter out global and local outliers was evaluated on 595 real yield datasets from different grain crops. Significant improvements in the distribution and spatial structure of yield datasets was found. Approximately 30% of the dataset size was removed from each monitor dataset, with one third of the removal occurring during filtering of spatial outliers. The automation of null, edge yield values and the removal of global outliers improved yield distributions, whereas the cleaning of local outliers impacted the yield spatial structure for all yield maps and crops. The algorithm proposed to clean yield maps is easy to apply for preprocessing the growing number of available yield maps.},

  abstract = {Yield mapping is increasingly used in agricultural management. The distributions produced from the majority of these datasets are non-normal and can be misleading if used in the decision making process. Numerous studies over the last 25 years, published in various formats, have highlighted the sources of errors that contribute to this non-normality and have proposed a variety of post-processing methods to reduce their effect. A comprehensive cataloging of the types of errors present and methods used to remove them as well as the approaches to and effects of post-processing error removal is needed. This review identifies four types of yield mapping measurement errors: issues associated with harvesting dynamics of the combine harvester, the continuous measurement of moisture and yield, the accuracy of positional data and errors caused by the harvester operator. Methods to remove errors range from simple thresholds to complex routines that incorporate harvest position and local yield variation. The benefits of applying filters have focused on the removal of erroneous yield variation based on simple descriptive statistics, the creation of yield distributions that show greater normality and the decrease of the nugget-variance relationship and prediction variance estimated in yield map interpolation. Publication of these parameters should accompany the interpolated yield map for both unprocessed and post-processed datasets to provide an insight into the reliability of the collected measurements and the effectiveness of the routines implemented. Examples from commercial growers in Western Australia are used to reinforce the review’s findings and highlight the potential for extensions to current methods to remove errors associated with harvester speed, narrow finishes and harvester turns and overlaps. This paper suggests extending the current routine implementation of error removal towards an automated post-processing system.},

Currently, either an assumed, fixed delay time is used or the delay time is determined by visual inspection of yield maps. Geostatistical and data segmentation methods were developed to estimate yield monitoring system delay time using objective criteria. The methods were validated with an ideal dataset and with elevation and soil electrical conductivity datasets having known delay times. When applied to yield and moisture content measurements collected with a commercial yield monitoring system, the methods successfully estimated delay time. In most cases, the results agreed (1 s) with results achieved using a visual method. Grain yield and grain moisture content exhibited different delay times at different locations within test fields. Thus, it may be appropriate to apply delay time corrections to homogeneous subfield areas, instead of on a wholefield basis. Use of these new estimation methods could allow for more accurate and efficient processing of yield monitor data.},

  abstract  = {1. Roads form a vast, rapidly growing global network that has diverse, detrimental ecological impacts. However, the habitats that border roads (‘road verges’) form a parallel network that might help mitigate these impacts and provide additional benefits (ecosystem services; ES).
2. We evaluate the capacity of road verges to provide ES by reviewing existing research and considering their relevant characteristics: area, connectivity, shape, and contextual ES supply and demand. We consider the present situation, and how this is likely to change based on future projections for growth in road extent, traffic densities and urban populations.
3. Road verges not only provide a wide range of ES, including biodiversity provision, regulating services (e.g. air and water filtration) and cultural services (e.g. health and aesthetic benefits by providing access to nature) but also displace other habitats and provide ecosystem disservices (e.g. plant allergens and damage to infrastructure). Globally, road verges may currently cover 270,000 km2 and store 0.015 Gt C/year, which will further increase with 70% projected growth in the global road network.
4. Road verges are well placed to mitigate traffic pollution and address demand for ES in surrounding ES-impoverished landscapes, thereby improving human health and well-being in urban areas, and improving agricultural production and sustainability in farmland. Demand for ES provided by road verges will likely increase due to projected growth in traffic densities and urban populations, though traffic pollution will be reduced by technological advances (e.g. electric vehicles). Road verges form a highly connected network, which may enhance ES provision but facilitate the dispersal of invasive species and increase vehicle–wildlife collisions.
5. Synthesis and applications. Road verges offer a significant opportunity to mitigate the negative ecological effects of roads and to address demand for ecosystem services (ES) in urban and agricultural landscapes. Their capacity to provide ES might be enhanced considerably if they were strategically designed and managed for environmental outcomes, namely by optimizing the selection, position and management of plant species and habitats. Specific opportunities include reducing mowing frequencies and planting trees in large verges. Road verge management for ES must consider safety guidelines, financial costs and ecosystem disservices, but is likely to provide long-term financial returns if environmental benefits are considered.},

Winner of the 2013 DeGroot Prize.

A state-of-the-art presentation of spatio-temporal processes, bridging classic ideas with modern hierarchical statistical modeling concepts and the latest computational methods

Noel Cressie and Christopher K. Wikle, are also winners of the 2011 PROSE Award in the Mathematics category, for the book “Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data” (2011), published by John Wiley and Sons. (The PROSE awards, for Professional and Scholarly Excellence, are given by the Association of American Publishers, the national trade association of the US book publishing industry.)

Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data has now been reprinted with small corrections to the text and the bibliography. The overall content and pagination of the new printing remains the same; the difference comes in the form of corrections to typographical errors, editing of incomplete and missing references, and some updated spatio-temporal interpretations.

From understanding environmental processes and climate trends to developing new technologies for mapping public-health data and the spread of invasive-species, there is a high demand for statistical analyses of data that take spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal information into account. Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data presents a systematic approach to key quantitative techniques that incorporate the latest advances in statistical computing as well as hierarchical, particularly Bayesian, statistical modeling, with an emphasis on dynamical spatio-temporal models.

Cressie and Wikle supply a unique presentation that incorporates ideas from the areas of time series and spatial statistics as well as stochastic processes. Beginning with separate treatments of temporal data and spatial data, the book combines these concepts to discuss spatio-temporal statistical methods for understanding complex processes.

Topics of coverage include:

    Exploratory methods for spatio-temporal data, including visualization, spectral analysis, empirical orthogonal function analysis, and LISAs
    Spatio-temporal covariance functions, spatio-temporal kriging, and time series of spatial processes
    Development of hierarchical dynamical spatio-temporal models (DSTMs), with discussion of linear and nonlinear DSTMs and computational algorithms for their implementation
    Quantifying and exploring spatio-temporal variability in scientific applications, including case studies based on real-world environmental data

Throughout the book, interesting applications demonstrate the relevance of the presented concepts. Vivid, full-color graphics emphasize the visual nature of the topic, and a related FTP site contains supplementary material. Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data is an excellent book for a graduate-level course on spatio-temporal statistics. It is also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the fields of applied mathematics, engineering, and the environmental and health sciences.},

  abstract  = {The world is becoming increasingly complex, with larger quantities of data available to be analyzed. It so happens that much of these "big data" that are available are spatio-temporal in nature, meaning that they can be indexed by their spatial locations and time stamps.

Spatio-Temporal Statistics with R provides an accessible introduction to statistical analysis of spatio-temporal data, with hands-on applications of the statistical methods using R Labs found at the end of each chapter. The book:

    Gives a step-by-step approach to analyzing spatio-temporal data, starting with visualization, then statistical modelling, with an emphasis on hierarchical statistical models and basis function expansions, and finishing with model evaluation
    Provides a gradual entry to the methodological aspects of spatio-temporal statistics
    Provides broad coverage of using R as well as "R Tips" throughout.
    Features detailed examples and applications in end-of-chapter Labs
    Features "Technical Notes" throughout to provide additional technical detail where relevant
    Supplemented by a website featuring the associated R package, data, reviews, errata, a discussion forum, and more

The book fills a void in the literature and available software, providing a bridge for students and researchers alike who wish to learn the basics of spatio-temporal statistics. It is written in an informal style and functions as a down-to-earth introduction to the subject. Any reader familiar with calculus-based probability and statistics, and who is comfortable with basic matrix-algebra representations of statistical models, would find this book easy to follow. The goal is to give as many people as possible the tools and confidence to analyze spatio-temporal data},

  abstract  = {To investigate whether floral resource quality impacts on bumble bee floral choices, we determined the pollen foraging constancy and floral choices of four bumble bee species commonly occurring in peaty, wet meadows in South Belgium. We subsequently analyzed the chemical contents of pollen and nectar, as well as the nectar production of the major host plant species. Individuals of B. lapidarius and B. pascuorum collected high-quality pollen (i.e., having high essential amino acid and phytosterol content) on Comarum palustre and Trifolium pratense, whereas individuals of B. terrestris s.l. and B. hypnorum enlarged their diet breadth to less valuable pollen resources (Cirsium palustre and Valeriana repens). Since Persicaria bistorta and Comarum palustre offer abundant and concentrated nectar, these plant species might represent major nectar sources for bumble bee species in peaty, wet meadows. The present study demonstrated the role of pollen composition on differences in foraging strategies among bumble bee species.},

  abstract  = {Four common species of bumblebees in central Maine each utilized the nectar from a great variety of both native and exotic flowers. The number of individuals that utilized a nectar resource was directly related to supplies available. Seasonally, @? 92% of the "Standing crop" of food energy available per day was utilized in 1972. No interference competition was observed, and competition was primarily exploitative. Small wild bees generally foraged at high temperatures from the small food rewards left after Bombus exploitation. Overlap in resource utilization in the guild of bumblebees was avoided by differences in tongue length. Open (short-corolla) flowers were visited primarily by short- and secondarily by long-tongued bumblebees. Deep-corolla flowers were visited primarily by long-tongued bumblebees. Pollen flowers were utilized more by short-tongued than by long-tongued bumblebees. However, the bumblebee forager spectra on given flower species varied from one locality to the next as well as seasonally. Colony polylecty is probably a necessary correlate of social behavior, given short blooming times of the host plants relative to the long durations of the colony cycles. In turn, colony polylecty of eusocial bees may decrease species richness in the bee community due to competition.},
