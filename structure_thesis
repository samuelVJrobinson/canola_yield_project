#BASIC STRUCTURE OF THESIS CHAPTER 3 (SEED PRODUCTION)

Abstract:

Insect-mediated pollination of crops is an important input to agricultural production, but pollination management suffers from key mechanistic gaps that hinder its greater utility. 
While pollination services to plants have a solid theoretical and mechanistic framework, agricultural pollination is often treated as a statistical ``black box", without reference to the mechanisms underlying the process of pollination and fruit production.
We present a causal model that links insect visitation to pollination to three separate components of yield, using two types of canola (\textit{Brassica napus}) production systems.
Commodity canola yield was mainly controlled by plant size, and there was no relationship between \textit{Apis mellifera} visitation and pollen deposition, or deposition and seed yield.
In comparison, seed canola yield was also controlled by plant size, but there was also a strong relationship between visitation and pollen deposition, as well as deposition and seed yield.
We also found that \textit{Megachile rotundata} visitation in seed canola strongly increased pollen deposition, but \textit{A. mellifera} visitation did not.
This model serves as a step towards a mechanistic model of pollination services, and points to the contextual importance of pollination services in seed canola production.

**Intro:

- Animal pollination is important

- Pollination isn't the same throughout fields

- Insect visitation can increase quantity/quality of pollen

- Seed production can be limited by plant resources as well as pollen

- Insect pollination is important for hybrid canola

- Fruit production involves a sequence (visit -> pollen -> fruit <- resources) that mediate crop yield

- In this study we modeled distance -> visits -> pollen
  Hypotheses:
  - Bees sensitive to flight costs, so greater distance = fewer bees
  - Visiting bees deposit pollen, so more bees = more pollen
  - Seed production is limited by resources, so bigger plants = more seeds
  - Seed production is limited by pollen, so more pollen = more/bigger seeds
  
**Methods:

*Data collection:

- We surveyed 29 commodity fields, stocking was ...

- We also surveyed 35 seed canola fields, stocking was ...

- In both fields, we established plots and made observations...

- We counted flowers, stigmas, and then collected plants at the end of the season

* Analysis:

- We used a piecewise SEM

- Underlying models were specified as GLMMs

- SEMs independence claims evaluated

- GLMMs were written in Stan, and evaluated ...

** Results:

- Plant size and pollen were drivers of yield in seed canola, only plant size in commodity canola

* Visits & Distance

- Bee visitation declined with distance from hives/shelters

- Leafcutter bees were more sensitive to distance

* Pollen & Visits

- Pollen enhanced by visits in seed canola, but not commodity

* Plant size & Seeds

- Plant size was influence by density, but not in commodity fields

- Plant size increased number of pods

- Plant size increased seed size and number in seeds, but not commodity canola

* Pollen & Seeds

- Pollen increased number of pods and seeds in seed canola, but not commodity canola

** Discussion:

- Study examined the strength of paths between these variables

* Visitation

- Honey bee visits declined with distance; visitation was higher in seed fields due to stocking rate

- Honey bee visitation was lower near leafcutter shelters

- Honey bee visitation and foraging differed between M and F bays, and within the F bays

* Pollen deposition

- Honey bee visitation did not increase pollen in commodity canola

- Honey bee behaviour in seed fields made pollen transfer unlikely

- Honey bees may have an indirectly positive effect on pollen deposition, by making leafcutters travel further

* Pod production

- Pod production in commodity canola increased with plant size, but not pollen
 
- Pollination increased crop production in seed canola, but not commodity canola

* Seed size/number

- In commdity canola, seeds per pod was not affected by plant size/pollen

- Plant size had a strong influence on seed size in seed canola, but not in commodity

* Summary

- This study assesses the relative importance of pollination and plant resources

- Future work
